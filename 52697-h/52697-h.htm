THE ALLEGHANIES.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I.</h2>

<p>“It is not in man that walketh to direct his
steps.” In all my connection with the scenes
here truthfully described, as in the training
and discipline of earlier years through which
I was brought into them, I have been <i>led in a
way that I knew not</i>.</p>

<p>I was born on the border of Western Pennsylvania
and Virginia, within the wilds of the
vast range of the Alleghanies, where the howl
of the wolf, the scream of the panther, and
the Indian’s tomahawk were my dread. In
infancy my father died, and a few years later
my pious mother. But God raised up a foster-mother,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
and in her family an intelligent
Scotch female teacher, who made me her
special charge during my first year at school.
Here, in connection with faithful preaching
from a tent in the woods on the Sabbath, and
instruction in the log-cabin day-schools, I received
those rudiments of education, and was
indoctrinated in that sound system of faith
and morals from which “old Scotia’s grandeur
springs.”</p>

<p>Conscious of my ruin by sin and need of
the “new birth,” as set forth in old standard
works of Flavel and Boston which I read, for
three years from ten to thirteen, I was often
deeply impressed as to the state of my soul.
I attended constantly on preaching and the
monthly examinations, committed to memory
catechisms and scriptures, and wrestled
with God in prayer that I might be truly converted
and become a minister of the gospel;
and sometimes I indulged a trembling hope
in Christ.</p>

<p>But among the snares and flatteries of ungodly
companions, my alarm and faint hopes
of salvation gradually subsided. I was at
length led to show my <i>manhood</i> by tobacco-chewing,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
card-playing, and even profanity.
Next I was enticed to read works on Universalism,
and for four years sought to stifle conscience
by arguments to prove that all will be
saved. Yet a still small voice was whispering,
“The soul that sinneth it shall die;” and
though jovial in company, when alone hell
would seem to flash up before me in all its
horrors. Two great powers were striving in
my heart: one to lead me into deeper sin;
the other crying, “Turn ye, turn ye; for why
will ye die?” At seventeen I went with an
ungodly young man into the then wilderness
of Central Ohio, where for half a year I heard
no sermon, hunted on the Sabbath, threw off
restraints, and as it were dared the vengeance
of God. Oh how astonishing the mercy
of God, to continue to strive with such a
rebel!</p>

<p>When I arrived at eighteen, I spent two or
three nights in a week at the card-table, to
“kill time” and drown the whispers of the
Spirit. I thought of enlisting in the army, and
then resolved to go to sea: but in the providence
of God, a young woman just then engaged
my affections; thoughts of the army
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
and the sea were dislodged, and in a few
months we were married, depending on our
personal exertions for the means of support.</p>

<p>We rented a piece of land, and entered upon
the scenes and responsibilities of real life.
After six months, I was seized with acute inflammatory
rheumatism, and the verdict of
the physician was, that the disease was incurable,
and I must die. Every feature was distorted
with agony; and yet the agony of soul
at the thought of being dragged into the presence
of God with all my sins unpardoned was
unspeakably more terrible. I saw that I had
shut my heart against the calls of God’s word
and Spirit a thousand times, and that I deserved
the deepest hell. I tried to pray, but
there seemed to be no God to hear, no Saviour
to intercede, no Spirit to comfort my lost
and wretched soul.</p>

<p>As I was recovering, “The Afflicted Man’s
Companion,” received from a friend, was
greatly blessed to me, and I resolved by
God’s help to live the life and die the death
of the righteous. The struggle now began in
earnest. Such was my agony of soul, that I
often went to the woods and rolled on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
ground for hours. Most of those around me,
for miles in every direction, were living in neglect
of God; intemperance fearfully prevailed;
there was not one religious friend to whom I
could reveal the feelings of my heart. I tried
to surrender myself to Christ, but in vain. A
voice seemed to follow me continually, “He
that is ashamed of me and of my words, of him
will I be ashamed before my Father and his
holy angels.” I felt that a public acknowledgment
of Christ and his cause was the only
way of relief; but I shrunk from the duty,
wishing to be a secret Christian, and go to
the Saviour, like Nicodemus, by night. This
distress continued for some months.</p>

<p>At length I was enabled to ask a blessing
at my table, which seemed a hard task before
my then irreligious wife; and after this it was
a struggle of six months before I could summon
courage to commence family prayer,
even on a Sabbath evening. This duty was
then performed, and peace of mind followed.
After a few months I made known the state
of my mind to the officers of a church some
miles distant, and was admitted, though with
many sore misgivings and fears that I had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
no right to the Lord’s supper, and was self-deceived.</p>

<p>God graciously removed these doubts, and
I felt the claims of Christ to do something
for others. I first engaged in loaning such
good books as I could get, especially The Afflicted
Man’s Companion, Doddridge’s Rise
and Progress, and Pike’s Persuasives to Early
Piety; feeling assured that no one could
prayerfully read either of these books without
being converted.</p>

<p>When I was in my twenty-third year, a
devoted Christian settled in a very wicked
community about five miles from me, where
he started a Sabbath-school. I went to see
it, and was greatly pleased with it. At the
close, I was introduced to Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;; and to
his influence, under God, more than to that
of any other individual, is to be traced all I
have been enabled to do for the salvation of
souls. He told me all about the management
of a Sabbath-school, and how to get books
from the American Sunday-school Union,
which had just begun its heaven-born work
in our country. I immediately set to work,
raised five dollars, procured ten dollars’ worth
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
of books, and opened a Sabbath-school in
my own house. The room soon became too
small; but God put it into the heart of an irreligious
neighbor to offer a larger room, where
the school was continued for a year, and
where I also held a weekly meeting, usually
reading one of Burder’s Village Sermons.
More room soon became necessary, and a
large school-house was built; and there, for
twelve long years, the Sabbath-school and
religious meetings were kept up, until nearly
all the youth and most of the adult population
in the neighborhood were brought into
the church.</p>

<p>This Sabbath-school and that of Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;
were the means God used to build up a good
congregation in one of the most wicked and
hopeless communities.</p>

<p>With these results before me, as soon as I
heard of Colportage my heart beat with joy
at the thought that the poor would soon have
the gospel preached to them, and that thousands
of children, untaught at home, would
be reached by soul-saving truth adapted to
their opening minds.</p>

<p>But the question came into my mind at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
once, “Who will go into these ignorant communities,
and deny themselves the comforts
of home, to do this work?” little thinking that
God, by fifteen years training, had selected
me for that very work in the Alleghanies.</p>

<p>An incident that occurred some years previous
made a deep impression on my mind.
The ecclesiastical body with which I was connected
had requested the officers of vacant
churches to visit all the families in those
churches, and talk and pray with them. I
shrunk from the task; but encouraged by
Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, I entered on it with fear and
trembling. By the time the first visit was
paid I felt as if I should like to spend my
days in such a work. Late in the evening of
my first day I stopped at a house where the
man and his wife were members of our church.
A young man was present who was to be married
in a few days. I had some acquaintance
with him, and asked him if he had ever felt
any concern about his soul. He said, “A
little sometimes, but not much.” I urged
him to seek first the kingdom of God: and his
righteousness, and said to him, “For aught
you know, before another morning you may
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
be dead, or on a sick-bed from which you
may never rise.” At midnight that night he
woke up sick. In a day or two I was sent for.
He told me the moment he woke sick he
thought of what I said, and felt that he should
never get well. He lingered three months;
but more than a month before he died he
professed his faith in Christ. From that time
till he died, he daily urged his ungodly, intemperate
parents to repent and meet him in
heaven. The father soon became much distressed
about his soul; and a year after, he
died a most triumphant death, committing
his children to my care for religious instruction.
Within a few years the mother and
most of the children were united with God’s
people. All attributed their salvation to the
exhortations of that son and those of us who
attended him and his father. This encouraged
me to try to do more.</p>

<p>On the morning of October 20, 1844, I
rose in peace, with my happy little family
around me; but a holy Providence ordered
that in twelve hours my dear wife was to be
in the cold embrace of death, and that her
death was to be the first of a chain of providences
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
to lead me “out into the highways and
hedges.”</p>

<p>The next Sabbath morning our pulpit was
occupied by Rev. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, who presented
the moral and religious wants of our country,
and tenderly appealed for laborers. At the
close of the service I was introduced to him,
and he accompanied me to the new-made
grave of my beloved companion. The band
that had bound me to my home was loosed.
On Monday morning the preacher called on
me again; preliminaries were arranged; and
I was commissioned as colporteur for Western
Virginia, consenting first to labor a short
time among the colliers in Western Pennsylvania.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II.</h2>

<p>I left home for the field of labor assigned
me on the first day of November, 1844.</p>

<p>On my way on horseback I came alongside
of a young gentleman of very fine appearance.
We immediately entered into conversation
about the beautiful farms and fine improvements
we passed.</p>

<p>When we had rode some distance, I observed
<i>a mile-stone</i>, which reminded me of a
promise made some years before, that I would
never travel a mile or spend an hour alone
with any person without talking on the subject
of religion. I immediately set about to
find something to make an introduction out
of. The first thing that caught my eye was
a very tall hickory pole, raised by one of the
political parties of the time, and said I feared
the political excitement was very seriously
affecting the interests of the church.</p>

<p>The evasive reply of the elegant young man
led me to suppose he was a gay, thoughtless
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
young lawyer or physician, as I had discovered
that he was an educated man.</p>

<p>I then observed to him that as we were
providentially thrown together, and I had
made a promise not to travel a mile or spend
an hour with any one without speaking on
the subject of religion, I hoped he had no
objections to such conversation.</p>

<p>He said, “It is no doubt an important subject,”
but said it in such a way that I still
thought he was an irreligious man.</p>

<p>I then observed that I felt a deep interest
in young men, especially as the destinies of
the church and nation would soon be in their
hands. That the only safeguard of either
was real piety. I then repeated the text,
“Except a man be born again he cannot see
the kingdom of God.” And after preaching
him a sermon from it near a mile long, he
observed,</p>

<p>“Well, sir, that is very good theology.”</p>

<p>The manner in which it was said led me
to reply, “Perhaps I have run against a
preacher.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” said he, “I am a new beginner
at it, and you have given me one of the best
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
lessons that I have ever learned. I thank
you for it; it needs no apology, and I hope
God will give me grace always to do likewise.”</p>

<p>Our journey as we continued it to Pittsburg
was pleasant and profitable.</p>

<p>In the evening I reached the hospitable
home of the Rev. Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; in the village of
T&mdash;&mdash;, near to the city. It had been arranged
for his house to be my headquarters,
and I shall never forget the nights I spent
with him and his devoted companion. I
thought him as nigh Christian perfection as
man is ever raised in this world. Had it not
been for their wise Christian counsel and earnest
prayers, my faith and courage would have
yielded when I came to look on my field of labor.
My new work, to which everybody was a
stranger, and to be done among strangers in
the bustle of business and worldly excitements,
seemed to be too formidable an undertaking.
All nations seemed to be represented;
scores intoxicated, and blaspheming
God’s holy name. And what added to the
difficulty was, that my books did not come
to hand for three days, leaving me that time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
to magnify molehills into mountains of difficulty.</p>

<p>But this delay was the most important part
of my training. Those were days of most
earnest searchings of heart, while such passages
of Scripture as, “He that is ashamed of
me and my words, of him will I be ashamed
before my Father and his holy angels,” were
constantly ringing in my ears.</p>

<p>On the evening of the third day the box of
books came. I had engaged a class-leader in
the Methodist church to go with me the first
day; but the sight of the box made me tremble,
and so great was the dread of beginning
the work that evening, that I resolved that if
God did not give me strength by the next
morning, I would start home and give it up.
The night was spent without sleep. I can
truly say I was in an agony till four o’clock
in the morning. Then in a moment of time
all my fears were gone, and I longed for the
morning to come that I might begin my work.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock in the morning I called on
Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; who was to accompany me, with
my basket filled with good books and tracts.</p>

<p>In a few minutes we entered the first house.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
They were Germans; very irreligious. We
talked and prayed with them, and sold some
books. They seemed pleased with the visit,
and thanked us for it.</p>

<p>The next house we entered bore the brand
of intemperance. The husband was sitting
by the fire with a sore hand and red eyes.
We preached to him “righteousness, temperance,
and a judgment to come,” till he trembled
and wept like a child. He promised to
drink no more, joined a temperance society
that night, became a church-going man, provided
for his family, and as far as I know
has turned out well.</p>

<p>During that day we visited twenty-seven
families, talked and prayed with all of them,
and distributed near twenty dollars’ worth of
books. Many shed tears while we talked
with them of Christ and salvation, and promised
to attend to the “one thing needful.”</p>

<p>Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, my fellow-laborer, was so stirred
in soul with the day’s work, that he said he
must let his business stand and go the next
day.</p>

<p>The next morning we started, full of zeal
and hope. We met with many of the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
wicked and degraded people that I had ever
seen. Some listened to us with attention,
while others treated us with contempt. Late
in the evening, while we were visiting a row
of board shanties, occupied by coal diggers,
I was told not to venture into one of the shanties;
that the man was almost a giant in size
and strength, and a very dangerous man; that
he was a terror to the neighborhood, and had
beaten his wife very badly the day before. I
replied there was the more need to see him,
and I would go in. My friend would not
even come to the door of the shanty, for fear
of him.</p>

<p>The shanty was sixteen feet square, no
floor but the earth; neither chair, table, nor
bed except a bundle of straw in one corner.
He was seated on a large block of coal at one
side of the fire, and his wife on another block
at the other side, while the children were
lying on the ground playing between them.
The woman’s face bore testimony of the beating
she had gotten the day before.</p>

<p>He was one of the most fiendish-looking
men I ever saw. He was of enormous size, was
clothed with rags, and did not appear as if he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
had been washed for months. He was as
black as coal-dust could make him. I must
confess it required all the courage I could
summon to speak to him.</p>

<p>I approached him, and extended my hand,
and said to him, “I have come to supply you
with some good books to comfort you and
point you to heaven. Have you a Bible?”
“No,” said he. “Can you read?” “Yes, a
little.” “Do you love Jesus Christ?” “I
fear not, sir.” I then urged him by every
thing sacred to attend to his soul’s salvation
without delay; that death, judgment, and
eternity were hastening on, and pictured to
him as well as I could the awful consequences
of dying in his sins. The tears ran down his
blackened cheeks till the coal-dust was washed
away below his eyes. I gave him a book,
and prayed with him. He begged me to call
again, and said, “You are the first man that
ever spoke to me about my soul.”</p>

<p>During this day we visited twenty-two families,
and had religious conversation and prayer
with each of them. Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; had become
so deeply interested, that he said he must go
another day.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>The next day we concluded to visit a coal
digger’s boarding-house, said to be the wickedest
den that was to be found in the whole
district. I will not attempt to describe its
character. We entered late in the evening,
as this was the only time we could find the
men in. The house was kept by an old
woman and her sons, who worked in the
mines and were notorious for their daring
profanity.</p>

<p>When we entered the house several men
were playing cards, others were lying on
benches about the room in various stages of
intoxication. My colaborer was a small, timid
man, and seemed somewhat alarmed.</p>

<p>I introduced our errand by proposing to
sell them some good books, which they declined
even to look at. I then commenced a
general exhortation, which had no effect more
than pouring water on a rock. I then called
on my friend to pray, as it was his turn, and
we had agreed to lead in turns. This he did
with great fervor, and was responded to by
the men with vulgar songs, and such other
behavior as I have never seen before or
since.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>At the close of his prayer I turned to the
old woman and told her I was astonished at
the mercy of God that permitted such a family
to live, and portrayed the awful consequences
of her meeting her household in hell.
I drew every alarming picture I could summon
from the Bible or the resources of my
own mind. After some time the old woman
began to weep, and she promised to attend
the mission chapel the next Sabbath. After
supplying them with a copy of Baxter’s Call,
and a number of suitable tracts, we left them.</p>

<p>The next Sabbath the old woman was at
the chapel. A series of religious meetings
began that day, and before its close, as my
friend informed me, who was a worshipper
there, the old woman and one of her sons
professed religion.</p>

<p>One day we entered a room where a man
was lying sick. We introduced the subject
of religion to him. He ground his teeth with
rage, and swore he did not want to hear any
thing on that subject. I then began to inquire
about his complaints, and to prescribe
some simple remedies, and he soon became
calm. After some time I remarked that afflictions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
did not come by chance, neither did
trouble spring out of the ground, but they
were all sent of God for some wise purpose.
“Do you think so?” said he. “Yes,” said I,
“and for our good.” He then listened attentively,
and soon shed tears. Though he was
very poor, he bought some books. I prayed
with him, and left him, but not without many
thanks and entreaties to come and see him
as often as I could.</p>

<p>This closed the work of three days, in
which time we had visited eighty-five families.</p>

<p>These three days were the most interesting
days that I had ever spent. By the next
morning I found my voice almost gone, and
all my limbs trembling. The excitement of
the work and intensity of feeling had prostrated
me before I was aware of it.</p>

<p>After a day or two of rest I resumed my
labors for three weeks, when I went home a
few days.</p>

<p>I then returned to the same place, and
spent a month in visiting new families and
revisiting old ones; and I shall never forget
the cordial shake of the hand that I got almost
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
every day, when I would meet some one
in the house or on the street whom I had
before conversed with and supplied with a
book or tract. Special services had been
held in several churches, and quite a number
had professed religion. One minister told me
he had taken into his church forty, many of
whom dated their first religious impressions
to reading the books and tracts I had sold or
given them, others referred to the visits as
the means of their awakening.</p>

<p>There was one thing in the work which
struck me with great force&mdash;the effect on
Christian people. I tried as far as possible
to get some good man to go with me in my
visits. It was a great help to me and added
to my success, and at the same time it stirred
up many to work for Christ that had never
done any thing before.</p>

<p>One instance I will name of a Miss L&mdash;&mdash;,
though she had been a worker. She was a
lady of large wealth, and had a number of
poor tenants living on her property. She
heard of my work, and came to see me. At
her request I went to visit her “parish,” as
she called it. I went at the set time, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
she was ready to go with me, basket in hand.
During the day we visited thirty families, and
talked and prayed in every house. When my
strength failed she took it up, and such entreaties
to sinners I have seldom heard, and
such prayers are seldom offered. During
that day I found eleven persons that attributed
their conversion to her efforts with books
and tracts. She said she was a colporteur
before, but did not know it till that day.
Reader, go and do likewise.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</h2>

<p>I now add a number of facts and incidents
that occurred during these two months of
labor.</p>

<p>There was a Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;, a coal-digger, of
desperate character, that I had been warned
not to visit. I was told that he was such an
abandoned character that he was hopeless;
that he spent the most of every night in a
miserable doggery, drinking and fighting. I
had passed his house every day for some
time, but did not feel satisfied with myself
for neglecting it.</p>

<p>At last I felt constrained to call one evening;
but he had not returned from his work.
I had a long, earnest talk with his wife, who
seemed very careless and wicked. All I could
say made no impression on her. I gave her
a copy of Baxter’s Call, with the earnest request
that she and her husband would read
it. What followed I will relate as near as I
can in his own words in a prayer-meeting in
his own house about two weeks after.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span></p>

<p>“While eating my supper, my wife told me
some man had been here and left a book,
which he was very desirous she and I should
read. I got the book to look at it, and read
a few pages without much interest; but as I
was very tired, I concluded not to go to the
grog-shop that night. In the morning, which
was Sunday morning, I felt inclined to go and
get my bitters; but seeing the book, I concluded
to read till breakfast, and then go. By the
time breakfast was ready I felt pretty serious,
and asked my wife if she would not like to go to
church&mdash;a place we had not been in for eight
years. She said she had no objections. I
read till it was time to go, and began to feel
somewhat anxious about my soul. I listened
to the preaching with intense interest. I read
the book nearly through that evening, went
back to the church that night, and when those
who desired to have an interest in Christ were
called for, I came forward. A week after, I
found peace.”</p>

<p>He then added, “If it had not been for
that book, I think myself and wife would
have been in hell to-night. That gun was
loaded,” pointing to an old gun in the corner,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
“with a view of killing myself and wife near a
month ago, and if God had not saved me, it
would likely have been done before this time.
I was a miserable man; life was a burden;
but now I am happy.”</p>

<p>This narrative brought tears to all our eyes,
and joy to our hearts.</p>

<p>I visited some of the grog-shops around
the village every day to supply their customers
with temperance tracts. In the village
proper, no liquor could be sold, as in all the
deeds for lots there was a temperance clause
that forfeited the property if liquor was sold;
but all round the village the grog was abundant,
and customers plenty.</p>

<p>Passing one of these drinking places one
day I saw several customers in, and entered
the bar-room with my tracts. The liquor-sellers
had got to know me, and often looked
daggers at me. A good-looking man, well
dressed, and about half drunk, was approaching
the counter to get a six-cent drink. Said
I, “My friend, I can give you something
for six cents that will do you much more
good, and no harm.” He asked me what it
was, when I presented to him Baxter’s Call.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
I told him the liquor might kill him, and if
he would read that book with prayerful attention,
it might save his soul. He said he
would buy the book if he had the money, but
that he had only six cents to pay for that
glass of liquor, which by this time was standing
on the counter.</p>

<p>We both came up to the counter, when I
laid the book beside the glass, saying, “Here
is life or death for six cents.” The grog-seller
said I had no business to come there annoying
his customers, and injuring his business.
I urged the man at the risk of losing
his soul to buy and read the book. The
struggle seemed to be between life and death.
At last he handed me the money, took the
book, and went out of the room. I then
handed the landlord a book worth more than
the whiskey, and told him to read it, and then
sell it to make up the loss. This is only a
sample of every day occurrences in village and
city colportage. Eternity only will reveal the
results.</p>

<p>At the request of the proprietors of a large
rolling-mill, I visited those in their employ.</p>

<p>Among them was a man that professed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
be a kind of Universalist preacher. He was
a boss over a number of hands, and I was
told was shrewd and fond of argument, and
was doing much injury in propagating his
opinions. Late one evening I called at his
rooms. There was no one in but his wife. I
conversed with her some time, and found her
a pious Christian woman. I asked her about
her husband. She burst into tears, and said
he was a kind husband, but a wicked man;
that he preached sometimes, and was a Universalist.</p>

<p>While I was urging her to labor and pray
for his salvation, a fine-looking man, of a
haughty mien and deportment, came in.</p>

<p>I arose and introduced myself, and asked
if he was Mr. V&mdash;&mdash;, the gentleman of the
house. He replied that he was. I then told
him I was a colporteur visiting from house to
house, selling and giving books, and talking
and praying with the people.</p>

<p>“Oh, I have heard of you about here for
two or three days. I am a Universalist, sir;
I don’t believe there is any such place as
hell.” I replied that it would be well for
many of us if that doctrine was true, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
asked him how long he had been a Universalist.
He said about eight years; that his
mother had belonged to the orthodox, and
taught him in his early years about a terrible
place called hell, and that he knew no better
till about eight years ago. That for three or
four years after he heard the true doctrine of
the salvation of all men, he was troubled
with those foolish prejudices; but for the
last four years he had never had a solitary
<i>pang</i> on that subject.</p>

<p>I replied that it was often hard to get rid
of a mother’s instructions and prayers; that
it had taken the devil four years to silence
his conscience, and get them put to sleep.</p>

<p>“Do you feel confident,” I said, “that you
are this moment prepared to enter heaven if
you were to die?” “Yes,” said he, “as certain
as I am that the sun rises and sets.”
“Well,” said I, “is not this rather a toilsome
world to live in?” “Yes,” said he, “it is,
and I have a full share of it.” “Then,” said
I, “why not cut your throat, and go right to
heaven this evening?” “Oh,” said he, “I
have my wife to provide for.” “Oh,” said I,
“cut her throat, and take her along.” “Oh,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
said he, “that would be wrong.” “No,” said
I, “if your creed is right, it cannot be wrong;
and even if it should, you would be done with
all the consequences of the wrong as soon as
you were dead.” He hung his head, and
made no further reply. I told him I hoped
that he had seen the fallacy of his belief, and
would at once abandon such soul-destroying
opinions. I sold him several books, and left
him.</p>

<p>As the men worked by turns all night in
the rolling-mills, and it was difficult to gain
access to them, one of the proprietors proposed
that he would join me to visit them all
the next Sabbath, when they often gathered
in groups to play cards and drink. Accordingly
the next Sabbath morning we were
joined by a theological student, and commenced
going round the houses and rooms,
near one hundred in number.</p>

<p>Late in the evening we entered the apartments
of Mr. V&mdash;&mdash; and his wife. They were
sitting reading new books, which I think were
those I had sold them. I said, “Good evening,
Mr. V&mdash;&mdash;. I have come to talk with you
again, and I am glad to see you reading those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
books. I hope you have changed your mind
on religious subjects.” “No,” said he, “I
am more convinced than ever that I am
right.” “Well,” said I, “I want to ask you
a few questions by the way of information,
as you profess to have a near cut to heaven.”
Said he, “I am not going to answer any more
of your questions. I don’t like to be criticized.”
I told him I would only ask him
easy questions; that I wanted to know what
that scripture meant which speaks of a class
of men who “shall not be forgiven, neither
in this world, nor in the world to come.”
Said he, “I am not going to answer any
more questions.”</p>

<p>Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; said he would like to ask him
one question. “There were two thieves crucified
with Christ. He said to the one, ‘This
day shalt thou be with me in paradise;’ where
did the other go?” He made no answer.</p>

<p>We all three united in urging him to repent
and believe in Christ, but he made no answer.
At last I said, “Brethren, unless God will
hear and answer prayer in this man’s behalf,
he is a lost man.” His wife was weeping as if
her heart would break. We knelt in prayer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
and I think there were four earnest hearts
lifted up to God. He sat still some minutes,
but at last he knelt. When we rose from
our knees the tears were running down his
cheeks. I said, “Do you feel no ‘pangs’
now?” With a sob that seemed to come
from his heart, he said, “I don’t know what
has come over me.” We then pointed him to
the Saviour, and told him we believed his
feelings were produced by the Spirit of God.
Of all the penitents that I have ever seen, I
hardly remember one who seemed so deeply
moved as this man. During the time he remained
in that place he seemed to be an entirely
changed man.</p>

<p>One day, accompanied by the Rev. Mr.
J&mdash;&mdash;, we called at the office of a very fine-looking
gentleman, and introduced the subject
of religion to him. He was rather surly
and sceptical. I proposed to sell him a book,
but he declined, saying that he seldom read
such books. At last I proposed to give him
a copy of Nelson on Infidelity, and went on
to say that it equalled any romance in interest.
At last he said, “I have money plenty
to buy books, and as you are so urgent about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
it, I will buy it, and read it; and if it is not
as good as you say it is, I will give you a
thrashing the first time I catch you.” I told
him I would run the risk of that if he would
read the book carefully.</p>

<p>About ten days after we were passing
again, and called on him. He met us in the
most cordial manner. I told him I had called
to see whether he would thrash me or not for
the book I had sold him. “Oh,” said he, “it is
the best book I ever read. I would not take
five dollars for it, if I could not get another like
it.” We found him deeply anxious about his
soul. After a long talk with him, I told him
I was about to close my labors there, and
never expected to meet him again in this
world, and urged him to meet me in heaven.
With tears running down his cheeks, he said
to Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;, “Will <i>you</i> not come and see
me again?” Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; said with tears that
he would, and he no doubt did very frequently.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV.</h2>

<p>Calling one day at a fine country-house in
Western Pennsylvania, I found a prosperous
Irish family of more than ordinary intelligence.
I inquired if they wanted some good
religious books. The father replied, “What
kind of <i>relagin</i> do you teach?” I replied,
“The holy catholic religion.” “Ah, it’s not
the Roman-catholic relagin. What objection
have you to the Roman-catholic relagin?”
I replied that all that I desired was,
to teach the people to repent and believe in
the Lord Jesus Christ and to lead holy lives,
and that I was not going about to argue with
people about their churches. Still he insisted
on my telling him what objections I had
to the Roman-catholic church.</p>

<p>At last I told him they violated the second
commandment by the use of images in the
worship of God. But this he denied. I asked
him to get his Bible and compare it with mine.
He brought out the Douay Catechism to prove
he was right, and told me that was his Bible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
I got mine; but he forbade my reading it, as
it was a heretic’s Bible. I insisted on having
Bible authority for the use of images in God’s
worship. As the old man seemed to be at a
loss to defend his position, one of his daughters,
a beautiful girl, presented herself before
me, and said, “I can give you Bible plenty
for the use of images, and the good resulting
from the use of them. What was it that Moses
put up on the pole for the Israelites to
look at when the fiery serpents bit them?”
I explained to her that the brazen serpent
was set up, not to be worshipped, but simply
looked at as a type of Christ, to whom dying
sinners may look and live. But all my efforts
were in vain. As I left them, she was still
asking me to repent, and come over to the
true Roman-catholic church as the only place
of safety.</p>

<p>A few days after, the Rev. Mr. J&mdash;&mdash; requested
me to visit the town of S&mdash;&mdash;, where
he occasionally preached, and had made an
appointment for me to address the people at
night, preparatory to visiting all the families.
He gave me a letter of introduction to one of
his members, who lived a mile from the village,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
and who he expected would go with me.
I came to his house near dark, almost frozen.
He received me very coldly, and neither offered
me food or company. I inquired the
way to town, and soon left.</p>

<p>The night was dark, the snow deep, the
cold intense, and I was an entire stranger in
the place. As I rode along the street, every
door and window was shut, till I came to a
store. I tied my horse and stepped in, and
found a large, fine-looking man sitting by the
stove alone. By asking a few questions, I
learned it was Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, the proprietor of
the town. I told him I was glad to make his
acquaintance. That I had come there at the
request of the Rev. Mr. J&mdash;&mdash;, to hold a meeting
that night, and to spend a few days visiting
his people and supplying them with good
religious books, and I would be glad to have
his counsel and advice as to the best way to
do it.</p>

<p>Said he, “It depends very much, sir, on the
kind of religious books you want to circulate
here. I suppose you have the Confession of
Faith of the Presbyterian church among them,
and I can prove that it is full of falsehoods;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
and more than that, I want you to know, sir,
that I have made a promise to kick out of my
house every man that comes in it that has
graduated at Jefferson College, and studied
theology at the Western Seminary.” As he
closed the sentence, he stood up before me, as
if he was going to make good his promise. I
requested him to wait till I should explain my
object. I told him I had no Confessions
of Faith, nor any denominational books; that
they were all the books of the American Tract
Society, and approved by nearly all evangelical
Christians, and consequently not sectarian.
And as to the other objection, I had
never graduated either at Jefferson College
or the Western Theological Seminary, consequently
he was barking up the wrong tree.
“Why,” said he, “are you not a Presbyterian
preacher?” “No, sir,” said I, “I
have not the honor to be a preacher.” He
turned instantly and walked out, leaving me
alone.</p>

<p>I stepped to the door, and asked a little boy
who was passing if there was a Mr. G&mdash;&mdash;
living in the town. “Yes,” said he, “he lives
in the adjoining house.” I stepped to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
door, and was cordially greeted by an old
acquaintance. In a few minutes I was seated
at a sumptuously supplied table, which I very
much needed; and an hour after was in a
school-house, holding forth to the people,
with my belligerent friend for one of my hearers.
I visited all the town; but Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;
carefully avoided meeting me, always turning
away to shun me; but I supplied his family
with a good stock of books.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>At the close of my labors in that town, I
entered a very hilly region of country, and
stopped over night with a Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, an
aged, infirm man, who sent his son with me
the next day to hunt up the cabins of the
poor. The son had spent some years in a
roving life, and seemed totally indifferent
about religion.</p>

<p>In the first cabin we called at, we found a
young woman in the last stages of a decline.
I have seldom seen any soul so full of joy and
peace. She talked more like an inhabitant
of heaven than of earth. While we spoke of
Christ’s love, and what he had done for her,
I saw the tears course down my companion’s
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
cheeks. When we left her he said, “Religion
is a reality.”</p>

<p>After visiting a few more families, we came
in sight of a beautiful farm, which lay in a
valley. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; said to me, “I will not
go with you to that man’s house. He is an
unbeliever, and a shrewd fellow, and if you
talk to him on religion as you have done to
others, he will get mad, and insult you. His
wife is pious; but I have heard him say that
when the preacher came to visit his family he
kept out of the way, because he did not wish
to insult him; and he will certainly insult
you, if you speak to him on that subject.”
Said I, “He has the more need to be visited.
Such persons are the very ones I am sent to
hunt up; but as he may take offence at you
for leading me to his house, you may fall behind,
and come up after me,” which he concluded
to do.</p>

<p>As I approached the house, I got off my
horse, and took my big saddle-bags, filled
with books, on my arm, and stepped into the
house. In a few minutes all the children were
in. They were fine, intelligent children; and
to my surprise, I recognized their mother as a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
once dashing young lady I had known well
fifteen years before; but she had entirely forgotten
me.</p>

<p>In a few minutes in came my travelling
companion and Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; with him; Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;’s face indicating great determination
and firmness. I immediately began to hunt for
a text to begin with, and chose a little girl of
three or four years old, whom I called to my
side. I began to tell her about Jesus, and
what he did to save sinners, and how deeply
praying fathers and mothers felt for their
dear children, whom they would soon meet
at the bar of God. I asked her if father and
mother did not pray for her. By this time
the mother and the oldest daughter were
weeping freely. I asked the mother if she
would not rather see her children converted
to God than any thing else. “Oh, yes,” she
exclaimed, “it burdens my heart.” I cast
my eye round towards Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; and Mr.
W&mdash;&mdash;, and both were weeping.</p>

<p>“Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;,” said I, “don’t you feel concerned
about the souls of this interesting
group of children which God has given you
to train up for Him?” “Not as much as I
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
ought to do.” His heart was so full he could
scarcely utter one word. Said I, “Are you
not a professor of religion?” “No, I am not.
I have been a very careless man on that subject.
When I was a young man I was very
much concerned for a while, but I fell in with
wicked young men, and read bad books, and
I have entirely neglected religion ever since.
But I don’t know what has come over me
now.”</p>

<p>“I trust,” said I, “it is the Spirit of God
that has touched your heart, and I beseech
you now to yield to his divine solicitations;
not to delay for one moment. If you resist
the Holy Ghost now, he may leave you for
ever, and then your doom will be sealed; but
if you now give up all for Christ, you will find
peace, and there may be joy in heaven among
the angels this moment.” He cried out in
the agony of his soul, “What shall I do to be
saved?” I urged him to enter that night on
all the duties that God had enjoined on him;
to read his Bible, and pray for himself and
family. He pledged his word to me to do it.
He kept that pledge. I prayed with him, sold
him eighteen volumes of good books, and left
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
the whole family in tears. He soon after
joined the church; and Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, I was
told, professed religion soon after, and attributed
his conversion to a day’s travel with a
colporteur.</p>

<p>I held a prayer-meeting that night at the
house of Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, a man of remarkable
piety and benevolence. He told me of an
incident that marked his whole life, and made
him what he was. Said he, “I served my
time with a hard master to learn the wagon-making
business. I had engaged to go, the
day I was free, some forty miles to work as a
journeyman. The evening before I was to
start, a good man gave me his advice, and at
the close asked me if I had money to pay my
way. I told him I had no money, but could
get there, as I was going to walk. He handed
me fifty cents, all he had, as a present.
While on my way I met a poor miserable
man begging. He told me he was starving.
I gave him the fifty cents, as I had no way
to divide it. Before I had gone many rods I
found a silver dollar lying on the road, over
which he had stepped. I said to myself,
‘<i>God sent this</i>,’ and I determined to serve him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
all the days of my life; and he has blessed
me ever since.”</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>In a few days I commenced labor along the
line between Western Pennsylvania and Western
Virginia. The Rev. Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; took a
deep interest in my work, and travelled more
than a week with me. Our work made quite
a stir among the people. The news spread
that we were entering every house, talking
and praying.</p>

<p>We set a day to visit a neighborhood that
was noted for its wickedness. There were
several families owning fine farms who never
entered a church. On the day set, we took
an early start. As we approached the first
house, we saw all the inmates running to the
barn. We knocked at the door, but no answer.
We went to the barn; but before we
reached it they were running across the adjoining
field. We understood the cause, and
came back to the house, and put in at the
window Baxter’s Call and a few suitable
tracts, with the earnest prayer for God’s blessing
to attend the reading of them.</p>

<p>We went on to the next house, but it was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
closed, and no one to be found. We here
also installed Baxter and several other preachers
through the window; and so on till we
had visited six families. At every one of
these houses the people either fled or concealed
themselves at our approach. Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;
pleasantly observed, as we were poor men,
he thought the best thing we could do for our
worldly interests would be to take possession
of the property, for he supposed they would
never come to dispossess us. Great fear fell
upon sinners at our approach.</p>

<p>A few miles distant I held a prayer-meeting
one night, and had a large crowd. At
the close, I laid my books on the table, and
told them that I would sell to any that wanted
to buy. In a little time the man of the house
told me that a man had <i>stolen</i> his pocket full;
that he was a very bad man, and we should
have a fight if we attempted to take them
from him. Among them was a fine pocket
Bible. So I concluded to let them go, and
pray that God would overrule his wickedness
for good.</p>

<p>Some weeks after, while visiting along the
Ohio river hills among the wood-choppers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
near the same place, I called at a cabin, and
found a woman in deep distress about her
soul. She told me she had got a book that
was the cause. That a man had sold it to a
neighbor. They were the fourth family that
had read it, and all were concerned about
their souls. I found all the families she
named, and the book thus blessed was a copy
of Baxter’s Call which that man stole from
me and sold to one of these families.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</h2>

<p>During my labors in this region I was frequently
requested to visit G&mdash;&mdash;, a town that
had been laid out about the close of the Revolutionary
war, and is noticed in the history
of the Indian wars as being near the scene
of some bloody struggles. It contained over
three hundred inhabitants, but never had a
church in it. A good man built one near
by.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. R&mdash;&mdash; sent a notice that he
and I would be there on a certain evening to
hold a meeting. A few came. He preached,
and I made a statement about my work, and
told them I was going to visit the town to
talk and pray with each family, and supply
them with religious books. I had engaged a
class-leader in the Methodist church, who
lived a few miles distant, to go with me.</p>

<p>We entered the village the next morning
soon after breakfast. The first four or five
houses we stopped at we could find no one at
home, and we soon found they were hiding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
from us. We could see heads out at the doors
and windows as we approached the house;
but when we would knock there was no answer.
As soon as we understood the matter,
I told my colaborer they should not foil us
in this way; that I would install preachers in
every house before I left the place. I immediately
commenced pushing in the old hats
that were stuck in the broken windows, and
threw into the houses a Baxter’s Call, Alleine’s
Alarm, or a Sabbath Manual, and some
of the most awakening tracts.</p>

<p>We spent two days in this work. With all
the skill we could use, we did not get into
one third of the houses; but we put good
books into every one.</p>

<p>Some few months after, a minister who was
preaching near by found many interested
about their souls. He held daily meetings
for some time, and more than fifty professed
faith in Christ; many dating their first religious
impressions to the silent preachers
thrown into their houses at the time of our
visit. In 1861, on the railroad, I passed in
sight of this town lying across the Ohio river,
and instead of the old dilapidated village it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
was seventeen years before, it looked to be
new and flourishing.</p>

<p>At the close of my labors in that community
I went to B&mdash;&mdash; county, Va., at the request
of Rev. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, who had a large country
charge and was laid up by bad health. He
requested me, in addition to visiting all the
families, to hold prayer-meetings among his
people every night. This I did for one month,
and God’s Spirit seemed to be present at
every meeting. Every one I talked with
seemed to be moved by the Spirit. I sold
more than $200 worth of books; and a few
months after, more than one hundred persons
were added to the churches. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; afterwards
stated that a large portion of them
had been led to consideration by reading the
books we scattered among them.</p>

<p>He often gave me directions where to go,
and what kind of people I should find them
to be. On one occasion he directed me to a
neighborhood where he had four or five families
living some miles from the church. The
parents all professors, with large irreligious
families, and no family altars.</p>

<p>The first family of them I called on, I soon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
found to be but little interested about religion.
I spoke with the father as if he were a
devout praying man; but told him I had no
doubt there were some prayerless families in
that neighborhood; and that God had declared
that he would “pour out his fury on
the families that call not on his name.” I
spoke of the sad effect of such ungodly living
on children, and urged him to try and talk
with all his neighbors about it, and to go with
me a day or two till we should try to wake up
such professors of religion. His family were
present. I saw his very soul was pierced.</p>

<p>I visited all the families the same way.
God’s Spirit seemed to stir every soul. In a
few months after, the pastor was able to visit
them, and found that each had established
the family altar. Each one resolved that he
would begin to pray in his own family, and
then he could go and urge others to do the
same. Neither of them supposed that I suspected
them of living without prayer till they
began to compare notes; and then they found
I had talked to all the same way. They sent
me their thanks by their pastor for “catching
them with guile.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span></p>

<p>In another neighborhood, I was urged by
a very good man to visit his brother-in-law,
who he told me was a wicked man, and raising
a large family like heathen. He told me
that he was a gentleman in his behavior to
strangers, and would treat me kindly; but to
secure for me a kind reception, he sent with
me a young man who was a nephew both of
himself and of the gentleman. The day was
extremely cold, and the distance some four or
five miles. We visited several cabins along
the river hills, and expected to reach his house
about noon, and remain there till the next
day.</p>

<p>About one o’clock we came to the place.
It seemed to be the abode of plenty. We
tied our horses, and entered a large front room.
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, the head of the family, was in it
alone, shelling corn on a machine, keeping up
a hot fire by burning the cobs. His nephew
introduced me to him, but he scarce looked at
me, spoke very little, and went on with his
work, without asking me even to sit down.
We both sat some time without a word being
spoken, when the young man passed through
into another room, where the family were talking.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
As soon as I got warm, I concluded to
try and do my work and leave the house, as
every thing looked rather gloomy.</p>

<p>He was a big, fierce-looking man. His countenance
indicated that he was a very wicked
man, which proved to be the fact. I sometimes
thought it would be best to leave him
without saying any thing, but my conscience
would not let me do that. At last I said, “Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;, I am engaged in distributing good
religious books, published by the American
Tract Society, and I have called to supply
you and your family with them.” I had scarcely
got the words spoken, when he sprang right
before me, with his fist clinched, and called
me a horse-thief and robber, and every vile
name that a vile tongue could use, interspersed
with the most awful oaths I ever
heard. He rubbed his fist under my nose,
and swore he would smash my face into a
jelly. I sat still for some time without speaking,
in the hope that he would stop, that I
might reason with him; but it was in vain.</p>

<p>At last I thought, if I am the cause of this
man’s sinning so much, I will leave him. I rose
to my feet and said, “Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, if you will
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
stop a moment till I speak, I will leave your
house. I came here at the special request of
Mr. E&mdash;&mdash;, your brother-in-law, to try to do
good to you and your family. And now, sir,
I warn you, that if you do not repent you will
perish. I leave a message from God to you
on this table,” placing there Baxter’s Call and
a number of tracts; “and if you reject them,
they will meet you as witnesses on the judgment-day.”
The wicked man quailed, and
tried to make apologies for his abuse of me;
but I told him to ask God for pardon, and not
me, for I was not in the least injured. I never
saw the place or the man afterwards; but I
heard he soon went to ruin. None of the family
showed their faces during the interview.</p>

<p>Eighteen years have now passed since these
labors were performed, and sufficient time has
elapsed for all the dust and excitement to pass
away; and on a calm review of that period of
my life and labors, I look on it as the most
important of any through which I ever passed:
not in actual results, but in the development
of a great system of evangelization, which has
carried salvation to thousands who had never
been reached by saving truth. A few had previously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
entered this field of Christian effort
for the destitute, and done much, north and
west; but this was the beginning of the work
in the middle and southern states, which has
reached millions of all classes and conditions,
both bond and free. As to myself, I found it
the best school I ever entered for spiritual
and intellectual improvement, and if I have
since been the instrument of any good to my
fellow-men, the labors of the little time referred
to prepared me for it.</p>

<p>At the close of this month’s work, two gentlemen
called on me one evening, and requested
me to take a walk in the village of
P&mdash;&mdash;. I was soon led into a tailor’s shop,
and had my measure taken; and then from
one store to another, till a fine new suit, from
head to foot, was selected, costing near fifty
dollars.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</h2>

<p>April 1, 1845, I commenced my labors in
the town of F&mdash;&mdash;, in Western Virginia. As
soon as the object of my visit to that region
was known, I received a cordial welcome from
a large majority of the people, who did all
they could to aid me in my work. Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;,
a young lawyer at that time, and since governor
of Western Virginia, volunteered to go
with me to every house in the town. His
high position and universal popularity made
the work pleasant and successful. In three
days my buggy load of books were circulated
in the village.</p>

<p>I immediately replenished my stock, and
commenced my work in the country among
the mountains. It was like a translation from
sunlight into darkness&mdash;from a high civilization
into one of ignorance and superstition,
with here and there a family of wealth and
refinement.</p>

<p>The very broken, rugged state of the country,
with a sparse population, rendered it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
impossible for the people to support either
schools or churches. Consequently in many
isolated communities whole families grew up
without any one knowing the alphabet, and
very few places had preaching more than
once in a month, and that on a week-day in
some log cabin to a few women. I have visited
as many as ten families in succession, in
one case fourteen, without finding a Bible.
It will hardly be thought strange that youth
of both sexes were often found who could
not tell who is the Saviour of sinners, and
that when they were told of Christ dying
for sinners, they would look incredulous and
say, we live so much out of the way that we
never hear any news. They often lived in
small cabins, without any furniture but such
as they made with an axe and an auger. All
they raised to eat was corn and potatoes, with
a few hogs; most of their meat being that of
the various wild animals which abounded in
the mountains. They were mostly kind and
hospitable, and seemed to be sorry that they
could not accommodate me better. I shall
endeavor faithfully to describe one journey,
which will represent many more.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>About the time I went into that region, a
new missionary circuit had been laid out by
the Methodist Protestant church through a
broken mountain country, where the gospel
had never been preached; and the Rev. Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash; was appointed to go round it once in
each month, which required a ride of more
than one hundred miles, most of the way by
mere bridle paths.</p>

<p>He had been once or twice round the circuit
before I became acquainted with him.
As soon as he learned my business he invited
me to go with him. He told me the people
were without books of any kind, that very
few could read, and that many of them were
not half civilized; that at one house, where
he spent the night, they cut off the skirts of
his saddle to sole their moccasins, and at another
the woman cut off the tail of his overcoat
to make a pair of pants for a little boy.
I agreed to go, and at the set time we filled
each of our saddle-bags with little books and
tracts, and our pockets with lunch.</p>

<p>The first appointment was some twenty
miles distant, and we had to start the evening
before. We stopped over night with a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
wealthy Christian family, and fared sumptuously.</p>

<p>The next day we rode twelve miles to
the place where he was to preach. They
had a church built of round logs. It had no
floor but the ground, and was neither chinked
nor daubed, consequently it was only used in
warm weather. The house was full at the
appointed hour. More than half of the congregation
were barefooted, and but few had
on them more than two garments. Most of
the men came in with their guns in their
hands, and a good supply of small game they
had killed by the way. The guns were all
set up in the corner of the church, and the
game laid beside them.</p>

<p>At the request of Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; I conducted
the service. The constant responses and
loud amens indicated the deep interest they
seemed to feel. At the close of the service
I requested them to keep their seats, and told
them I would go round and give each a tract
or little book. More than half the families
represented were destitute of the Bible. The
tracts and books were received with very great
joy, though few could read a word in them.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span></p>

<p>At the close we had to ride some miles to
a stopping place for the night. We found
the cabin small and destitute of any seats except
stools. The beds were poles put through
the corners, covered with the skins of deers
and bears. Many of the spaces between the
logs were wide enough for the dogs and cats
to pass out and in at pleasure. The food was
bread made of corn ground in a hand mill,
or pounded in a hominy block. The meat
was coon or opossum, and the coffee made
of chestnuts. The night was spent in self-defence
against unseen foes, and in dread of
snakes. After partaking of a breakfast similar
to the dinner and supper just described,
and praying with the family, we left them.</p>

<p>Our appointment for that day was about
twelve miles distant, with a constant succession
of mountains to cross. We stopped at
all the cabins by the way, which were about
like that just referred to, with one exception;
and as the house and family were different
from any that I have ever seen, I shall try to
describe them.</p>

<p>The cabin was about eighteen feet square;
had been the birthplace of a large family;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
had neither floor&mdash;except the earth&mdash;upper
story, chimney, chair, table, or bed, except a
pile of straw in one corner, and an old spinning
wheel and loom. The family we saw
consisted of the father, mother, and five
daughters, no one of which, we supposed,
would weigh less than one hundred and fifty
pounds. Each of the females had on a single
garment made of coarse linen, held on by
a drawing-string round the neck, all fleshy
and hearty, while we could not see any thing
for them to live upon.</p>

<p>No one of them knew a letter in the alphabet,
or who was the Saviour of sinners. They
were children of nature isolated from the
world, equally ignorant of both its vices and
its virtues. We spent more than an hour
trying to teach them the alphabet of Christianity,
and then commended them to God.
They seemed amazed at what we said; God
only knows the results.</p>

<p>We reached the place where our evening
meeting was to be held after one o’clock, exhausted
with hunger and heat. The cabin
was but little better than the one just described;
it contained some kind of table and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
a few stools, but had neither door nor floor,
and cattle and hogs ran into it to avoid the
flies when they chose.</p>

<p>Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, whose patience was nearly exhausted,
told the woman that we were almost
starved, and to hurry and get us something
to eat, and to make it as <i>clean</i> and as good as
she could. The children were sent to borrow
tools; a fire was soon blazing under an arbor
made of bushes near the house; a pail
of meal set beside it, waiting for the <i>skillet</i>
to heat, out of which the hens helped themselves
every time she turned her back to
them. The children soon returned with a
little coffee-pot minus the handle, and with a
knife and a fork one prong lacking.</p>

<p>We were soon invited in to our dinner from
under the shade of a tree where we had observed
the whole process. The table was a
block of wood, with four legs to hold it up,
and a stool at each side for us to sit on.
Some pet pigs were under it waiting for the
crumbs: they tramped on our toes, which led
us to kick them; but our kind hostess soon
made the children catch them and confine
them behind my back in a big gumm, a tub
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
sawn off a hollow log, which treatment, from
their noise, they seemed to dislike very much.</p>

<p>Soon after our meal was finished the people
began to gather in to hear the gospel.
The cabin was more than full, with the same
appearance of the congregation as last described.
We supplied all with books and
tracts&mdash;in most cases with the first book they
ever had. The night was spent much like
the previous one, food and lodging about the
same.</p>

<p>The next morning we rode nine miles to
meet another appointment at eleven o’clock.
By the time we reached the place I was so
sick that I had to lie down, while brother
C&mdash;&mdash; preached to the people from Jeremiah
6:16. At the close we supplied all with little
books and tracts, and received many
thanks. The dinner was set under a shed
outside of the house, but the sight of it sent
me out to the shade of a tree so sick that I
could not stand on my feet.</p>

<p>I then told brother C&mdash;&mdash; that I should be
compelled to make my escape to some place
where I could get something to eat and take
some rest; and asked him to take all the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
books and give them away at each appointment
to the best advantage he could.</p>

<p>At two o’clock I was on my horse, which,
happily for me, had been along the road before,
and was suffering from hunger as much
as his rider. In six hours he was standing
at the steps of Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;’s house, two miles
from the town of F&mdash;&mdash;, from which we started
three days before. I was well acquainted
with Mr. S&mdash;&mdash; and his family, having been
frequently there; but fever had dethroned
my reason, which did not return till I was
taken in and my head bathed with cold water,
and I had drank a cup of coffee.</p>

<p>It was three days before I was sufficiently
recovered to resume my work. We had visited
twenty-seven families, talked and prayed
with them all, given them books and tracts,
and held three meetings. One half of the
people were without any part of a Bible. As
for other books they had none, and not one
in ten could read a word.</p>

<p>I have detailed this one journey of three
days not only to show the condition of this
portion of our country, but as little more than
a fair representation of destitute parts of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
many states in the Union. If each colporteur
of the Tract Society who has visited
these dark, broken, isolated regions of our
country for the last eighteen years, had kept a
journal of all the ignorance and wretchedness
he met, it would have been the most interesting
missionary journal the world ever saw. Their
reports would differ as widely as the reports
of those whom Joshua sent out to visit the
promised land. While some would bring in
the rich clusters of Eshcol, others, with equal
truthfulness, could say that the land was inhabited
by giants, whose walls were ignorance
and superstition.</p>

<p>I was often reminded in my journeys of the
early pioneers of our country who went
through the forests, tomahawk in hand, blazing
the trees as a signal of their intended
occupancy of the land at some future time.
These visits were the Christian pioneer’s
way-marks, not blazed on the trees with axe
or tomahawk, but blazed on the hearts of
men in a state of nature by kind Christian
words, and sealed with earnest prayer; while
the books and tracts, including many Bibles
and Testaments, were deeds of trust to those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
that faithfully used them; and many by them
have secured a title to eternal life.</p>

<p>The books were like Jacob’s well&mdash;the digger
was gone&mdash;but they have quenched the
thirst of many a weary traveller on life’s journey,
and their smoked pages are still crying,
“Ho, every one that thirsteth,” come and
partake of the waters of life “without money
and without price.” A poor woman who
had a small tract given her, on her death-bed
had it brought to her, when she kissed
it, and said, “This led me to my dear Saviour.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p>I visited an old woman, who told me that
soon after she was married some one lent her
Doddridge’s Rise and Progress of Religion
in the Soul, and that it was the means of the
conversion of herself and her husband; that
he had died happily some years ago, but she
had never been able to get a copy of the book
since. I then presented her with one, and
she wept for joy. I asked her if she had a
Bible; she said, “No;” that they had a Bible
when her husband died, but some time after
a little school was opened in the neighborhood,
and she wanted her four little boys
taught to read, but had no books nor any
way to get them, and she had to cut her Bible
into four parts to make each of them a book,
and they soon went to pieces, and she lost
her Bible. I then gave her a Bible, and her
joy seemed complete.</p>

<p>On another occasion I sent a notice that I
would be at a little church in a certain neighborhood
to aid them in organizing a Sabbath-school,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
and to supply the destitute with books.
After exhorting for some time, and arranging
for the Sabbath-school, I distributed all my
stock, and was about to leave.</p>

<p>A young woman came up to me, having
just reached the place, and asked me for a
book. I told her I had given away all that
I had brought with me. She burst into tears,
and said, “I left my babe, three weeks old,
in the field where my husband was hoeing
corn, and walked five miles in my bare feet to
get a book; and now I am disappointed.” In
a few minutes an old woman who had seen
seventy winters came to me with a crutch
under one arm, and a cane in the other hand,
and told me she had come two miles to get
books for her sons, who were raising large
families over the mountains, that were as wild
as the deers. I returned soon, and gave the
necessary supply.</p>

<p>One day a man entered my room wearing
a hunting-shirt and moccasins, with a gun in
his hand and a long knife hanging to a belt
at his side, and asked me if I was the man
that gave books to the poor people in the
mountains. I told him I was engaged in that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
business. “Well,” said he, “we live in an
out of the way place, where we have neither
schools nor preaching; and we met together
last Sunday to see if we could not raise a
Sunday-school, and teach our children to
read, but all the books we could find was one
New Testament; and some one said there
was a man in F&mdash;&mdash; that was giving books to
the poor, and so I have come to see you about
it.” I gave him all the light I could as to
forming and conducting a Sunday-school, and
added twenty Testaments, with fifty small
volumes of Tract Society books, and some
tracts. He soon had them all in the bosom
of his hunting shirt, and I have seldom seen
a happier man.</p>

<p>The next Sabbath the school was started.
In six months a church was organized, and
soon after a little church built, and a man of
God was preaching to them once each month.
That bosom full of books was the means God
blessed to this result.</p>

<p>On another occasion I stopped over night
with a good man, who related to me the following
fact.</p>

<p>“A few years ago a minister came to my
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
house late on Saturday night on his way to
preach at L&mdash;&mdash;, about thirty miles distant.
Finding he could not reach the place in time
to meet his appointment, he told me if I
would gather in my neighbors, he would
preach for us. There were but a few families
in all this valley, and so far as I knew, he was
the first preacher that ever had been in it, at
least he preached the first sermon. I sent
my boys out and gathered in my neighbors.
At the close of his sermon he gave every one
a tract. Among the rest he gave one to a
poor widow with a large family, but neither
she nor any one of her children knew a letter.
She took it home with her without any knowledge
of its contents.</p>

<p>“The next morning she returned and requested
my wife to read it to her, which she
did. ‘Well,’ said she, ‘it is a nice thing to
read; I do wish I could do it.’ She took the
tract home, and returned the next day to
have it read again; and during the reading,
the tears ran down her cheeks. ‘Oh,’ said
she to my wife, ‘do you think I could learn
to read?’ ‘Yes,’ she said to her, ‘no doubt
you can.’ So my wife got a New England
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
primer we had, and went over the letters a
few times with her. She took home both the
primer and the tract. The next morning she
returned again, and while the tract was reading,
her face was lit up with joy, and peace
came into her soul. In a few hours she was
able to repeat the alphabet. ‘And now,’ said
she, ‘if you will only learn me how to put two
of them together, and give them a <i>name</i>, I
can learn myself.’ This was soon done; and
as soon as she went home, she taught her
children all she had learned. In a few months
she and her children could read all that was
in the primer. We have now a good church
here, and she and most of her children are
members of it. She seldom sees a tract but
with tears of joy she exclaims, ‘If it had not
been for one of these little tracts, I and my
children might have remained in ignorance
and sin.’”</p>

<p>One of the great difficulties I had to encounter
was the large number of families that
could not read. These I found every day.
When I would show my books and urge them
to buy, the reply was, “<i>Oh, none of us can’t
read.</i>” I soon saw the necessity of planning
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
some means to remedy this evil, and began
to establish little Sunday-schools in each
neighborhood. I would hunt up the best
reader I could find for a teacher, furnish
them with a small library of books, give them
the best direction I could how to conduct it,
and set them to work. Although some of
these schools were very superficially conducted,
and in many cases there was nothing done
in them but teaching young and old to read,
still they had the effect of rousing the mind
to the acquisition of knowledge, and preparing
the way of the Lord. Many of these
schools accomplished great things, and resulted
in the establishing of little churches.
Others seemed to fail, except so far as they
woke in the minds of some a thirst for knowledge.</p>

<p>Some families I could not prevail on to
take a book as a gift, for fear there was some
trick about it. Clock pedlars had been
through some portions of the country a while
before, sold the cheap clocks at thirty dollars
apiece, and took notes for the pay, which
had been collected in many cases by distress-sales.
They would tell me how they
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
had been treated, and that they were afraid
I should send some one for the pay. I often
avoided this objection by lending the book,
and writing on it, “Loaned till I call for it.”</p>

<p>Another great difficulty we had to encounter
with these unlettered masses was their
prejudice against education. Almost every
day I had to meet this objection: “Oh, I don’t
want my children learned to read; it will
spoil them. I have got along very well without
reading, and so can they.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_VIII">CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

<p>I had now been about ten months in the
colporteur work, and seeing the great necessity
for scores of men to engage in it, I
thought I could raise the salaries, and employ
one or two others to carry it on. I soon
raised $150 to pay a man for a year, and
Providence directed me to a good man to
do the work. I then succeeded in finding
another good man, and raising his salary;
and in one month, by the Divine blessing, I
raised and paid over for the support of colportage
$750, and these efforts were continued
till the colporteur work was extended throughout
the more destitute regions in all Western
Virginia.</p>

<p>I had made an arrangement to visit R&mdash;&mdash;
county, some forty miles distant, and spend a
month in colporteur labor. On my way I
had to cross a river by a ferry-boat. Two
travellers crossed with me. When we mounted
our horses on the opposite side of the
river, one of them asked me if I was going on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
a long journey with such a heavy load on my
horse over that mountain country. I told
him I had my horse loaded with religious
books, and some Bibles, and that I was engaged
in supplying destitute regions with the
word of life, and would soon lighten my load.</p>

<p>“Why,” said he, “are there any families
to be found without the Bible?” Yes, I told
him, there were many in all parts of our country.
“Well,” said he, “I don’t believe there is
a family in my county without a Bible.” Said
I, “What part are you from?” “From Green
county, Penn.” “How far,” said I, “from
the town of C&mdash;&mdash;?” “Five miles,” said he.</p>

<p>Four weeks ago, I replied, I was there,
and made an address before one of the Presbyteries
of the Cumberland church, in which
I spoke of the destitutions of our country and
our mode of supplying them, when the Rev.
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; followed me with a speech in which
he said “he believed one third of the families
in C&mdash;&mdash;, in which we were then assembled,
were without the Bible.” Another minister
present doubted it. I told them I was there
to visit the town, and would begin the next
morning. A good man volunteered to go
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
with me. We spent three days at the work,
and found that out of <i>one hundred and fifty-seven
families, fifty-four</i> had no Bible.</p>

<p>On my way to R&mdash;&mdash;, late in the evening
I began to inquire for some place where I
could spend the night, as the indications
seemed to be that a hard night’s lodging
was before me. As I inquired at each little
cabin, they told me that “Parson W&mdash;&mdash;,”
a few miles ahead, kept lodgers. As these
mountain miles are slowly measured by a
tired man and horse, I did not reach “Parson
W&mdash;&mdash;’s” till near nine o’clock at night.
When I entered his little cabin, he and his
wife and granddaughter were at a supper of
corn-bread and buttermilk. I asked for lodging,
which was granted, and was at once invited
to supper. As soon as the parson was
done eating, he went and put up my horse.</p>

<p>On his return, I asked him if he had any
pastoral charge. “Yes,” said he, “I built a
church on my own land close by, and preach
there every other Sunday.” We were soon
engaged in a religious conversation, and my
views of truth were soon tested. “Well,”
said the old parson, “I thought you was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
Methodist preacher, but I find I was mistaken;
but I <i>guess</i> you are a Presbyterian, which
is no better.” Finding the old man belonged
to what was called the <i>Ironsides</i>, or rigid
Antinomians, I thought it quite useless to
talk to him.</p>

<p>Before I could get rid of him he made me
tell my business. “Well,” said he, “you are
going about plundering the country. It was
the Bible, Tract, and Missionary Societies
that broke up the country in 1837 and ’38.”</p>

<p>As I was tired, and proposed to go to bed,
“Well,” said he, “there is a bed in that corner
for you.” “As you are a preacher,” said
I, “of course you have family prayer, and I
would prefer waiting to join you in it.” “Ah,”
said he, “every one does their own praying
here.” “Is it possible,” said I, “that you are
a preacher, and have no family prayer, when
God has said he will pour out his fury on the
families that call not on his name?” “Oh,”
said he, “you may pray if you please.” Seeing
an old family Bible on a shelf, I took it
down, and read a part of the seventh of Matthew.
I commented on the verse, “Strive to
enter in at the strait gate,” etc. The moment
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
prayer was over, he said, “I don’t believe a
word you said.” I was soon in bed and
asleep, being tired.</p>

<p>When I awoke there was a good fire, and
the old man sitting beside it. I was up in a
few minutes. “I am glad you are up,” said
he, “as there is another point I must discuss
with you.” In a few minutes I quoted proofs
from the Bible too clear to be resisted; when
the old woman, who was of huge dimensions,
sprang out of bed in her night-dress, and presenting
herself before me, said, “Don’t talk
to that fellow; he is a Yankee, and he is setting
traps to catch you.” The old man soon
disappeared to attend to his still-house and
cattle, and the old woman and granddaughter
occupied the whole front of the fire, making
their toilets; the old lady, in her earnest conversation,
frequently using a long wooden fire-poker
in close proximity to my head.</p>

<p>As the granddaughter was sitting near me,
completing her toilet, I spoke to her about
her soul, and offered her the Dairyman’s
Daughter. This roused the old woman again;
and the old man, returning about the same
time, forbade her to touch the book. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
girl cried bitterly, and said it was such a
pretty book she did want it, and there was
not a book except the old Bible in the house.
The girl’s tears prevailed, provided I would
write a receipt in it that it was paid for, which
was done.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over, and my
horse ready, I asked for my bill. “<i>One dollar</i>,”
said the old man; “I make it a rule,
when any of you Yankees come this way, to
fleece you as well as I can.” This man was
rich; had a great distillery, and I was credibly
informed would take a bottle of whiskey
with him to the church, and at the close of his
services tell his people what a fine run of whiskey
he had just had, and to come and taste it.</p>

<p>About a month after, on my return home,
I stopped to stay all night some few miles
from there, when lo, Parson W&mdash;&mdash; had stopped
to stay too; but as soon as he saw me, he
ordered his horse, and left. I had told about
my lodging with him; and as the laws of Virginia
at that time imposed a fine of twenty dollars
on any one who had no license charging
for lodging, some one had told the old man
that I was going to bring him before the court.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_IX">CHAPTER IX.</h2>

<p>About this time an incident of peculiar interest
took place. The Rev. Mr. Q&mdash;&mdash; had
invited me to visit the town of C&mdash;&mdash;, and I
had set a day to be at his house. Late in the
evening of the day appointed, I arrived in the
town; and while driving along the street,
looking for his house, I saw him standing on
his portico, beckoning me to him.</p>

<p>As soon as I had alighted from my buggy,
he gave me a cordial shake of the hand, and
said, “You have come just in time to see and
hear one of the greatest dignitaries in the
state of Virginia.” I observed that I was
perhaps a little different from many others;
that I would not go a square to see a great
man, unless he was a <i>great good man</i>. “Well,”
said he, “he ought to be a good man; he’s
the bishop of the Roman-catholic church for
this state; and as he is the first live bishop
of the <i>Holy Catholic</i> church who has ever been
here, he is attracting a great deal of attention.
He preached in the court-house this morning,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
and it was crowded; and he is going to preach
here for several days and nights. He has one
or two priests with him, and they have come
to plant a church here. Will you go and hear
him?” “Yes,” said I; “if you go, I will go
with you.”</p>

<p>As soon as tea was over, we went to the
court-house, and it was crowded. In a little
time the bishop arose, and without any introductory
services, gave out his text: “Thou
art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my
church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail
against it.” He went on to define “the gates
of hell” as the various Protestant sects, and
wound up by trying to prove that Peter was
the first pope, and got the keys, and that the
successors of Peter still held the keys, and no
one could enter heaven without going through
the Catholic church. His sermon was delivered
with earnestness and eloquence, and
made a deep impression, as very few of all
present were well informed on those matters.</p>

<p>He made much for his cause out of the denominational
strifes with which that region
had been afflicted, and I heard many say
“Amen” to some of his thrusts. He announced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
that he would preach the next morning
from the text, “Search the scriptures, for
in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they
are they which testify of me.”</p>

<p>We returned to brother Q&mdash;&mdash;’s, and sat to
a late hour consulting what we had better do.
Here was a man of Jesuitical cunning, misrepresenting
Protestantism before a community
ill qualified to form correct opinions. I
urged Mr. Q&mdash;&mdash; to contradict some of his
false statements; and after praying over the
matter, we retired.</p>

<p>The next morning, at the appointed hour,
the house was crowded, though there were
not one dozen Roman-catholics in the community.
Owing to the crowd, Mr. Q&mdash;&mdash; and
I got separated. I lost sight of him, and for
want of a seat elsewhere, got up into a window.
In a little while the bishop announced
the text, “Search the scriptures,” and also
announced that he would preach at night from
the text, “These were more noble than those
in Thessalonica, in that they searched the
scriptures daily.”</p>

<p>The ground taken in this sermon was, that
searching the scriptures by the common people
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
had led to all the religious heresies in the
world, and had raised up more sects than
there were chapters in the Bible. That there
was but one true church, and out of all only
one could be right. That Protestants called
Luther a great reformer, and he was told
there were no Lutherans in that town; consequently,
if Luther was right they were all
wrong; and if they were right, Luther was
wrong, and could not be a great reformer.</p>

<p>He said the Catholic church could not be
wrong; that she was infallible; she was “the
pillar and ground of the truth.” He pictured
the quarrels among Protestants in the most
hideous manner, and described a heaven full
of such uncongenial characters, till the picture
was ridiculous; and I saw that many
present were delighted with it.</p>

<p>At the close of his sermon, or tirade against
the Protestant religion, he sat down. I rose
up in the window, much excited, to see if the
Rev. Mr. Q&mdash;&mdash; would not call him to an account,
when I was much gratified to see the
meek and gentle form of Mr. Q&mdash;&mdash; slowly
rising about the middle of the house. Said
he:
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>“Bishop, you said in your sermon last
night that there were now two hundred millions
of faithful Catholic children in the world,
against which the gates of hell could not prevail.
Will you be kind enough to tell us
where they are?”</p>

<p>The bishop rose with a half-courteous and
half-disdainful smile, and said, “You need
not ask me such a question as that; the regions
they occupy are all marked on your
own Protestant geographies; your little boys
in the streets can point you to them, where
they have been marked in black lines,” and
took his seat.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Q&mdash;&mdash;, “I would prefer
you would name the countries to which they
belong.”</p>

<p>He rose again with a most indignant frown.
Said he, “I suppose it would be rather humbling
to one who calls himself a preacher to
go to the little boys for information, so I will
name some, at least, of the countries that are
Catholic: France, Austria, most of Germany,
Hungary, and Poland; and we shall soon have
England, as part of the church there is only
separated from us now by name; and Spain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
and Mexico are ours entirely;” and he took
his seat again.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Mr. Q&mdash;&mdash;, “do you think we
should gain any thing as a nation by changing
our Protestant religion for that of Mexico
and Spain?” and he took his seat.</p>

<p>The bishop arose still more indignant in
manner, and said, “I really cannot understand
what you mean, sir, unless you refer to
your boasted liberties in this country; but if
that is what you mean, sir, I can tell you I
would rather go to heaven from Mexico or
Spain, than to hell from the midst of all your
boasted liberties.”</p>

<p>By this time the audience had become intensely
interested. Said I, “Mr. Bishop, I want
to ask you a few questions by way of gaining
information. If I understood you right last
night, you said your church was infallible;
that it never had erred, and never could err.”</p>

<p>He replied very indignantly, “I said, sir,
that the Catholic church never had erred,
and never could err.”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” said I, “it was once right to
put Protestants to death for their religion,
and of course it is still right.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span></p>

<p>He replied, “That is a Protestant falsehood,
sir; the church never put any one to
death.”</p>

<p>Said I, “Sir, I can prove what I say by
the faithful records of history.”</p>

<p>“Protestant authority&mdash;we could not admit
such testimony, sir.”</p>

<p>“Well,” said I, “whether you admit it or
not, the blood of martyred millions is crying
for vengeance, and the day of divine recompense
will erelong come.”</p>

<p>After a number of questions from Mr.
Q&mdash;&mdash; and myself of similar import, Mr.
Q&mdash;&mdash; said, “The general opinion is that
General Washington and General Jackson
died good men and went to heaven. What
is your opinion, bishop?”</p>

<p>He replied contemptuously, “Why, sir, we
don’t pretend to know whether they are in
heaven or not; those are the secret things
that belong to God.”</p>

<p>“Stop, bishop,” said I, “you said last
night that you held the keys of the kingdom
of heaven in your church, and that to you it
was given to open and shut the door; and I
now demand of you as one of these door-keepers,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
to tell us whether you have let in
the immortal Washington or not.”</p>

<p>In a few moments the call was coming from
every part of the house, “Tell us whether you
have let Washington into heaven or not.”</p>

<p>The bishop tore his surplice off in a rage,
and put out of the house with one or two
priests after him&mdash;the crowd following him,
and calling out, “Come back and answer the
question about our beloved Washington.”
But he went on, ordered his horse, pronounced
a curse on the place, closed his
meetings, and left the town. The excitement
of the crowd was most intense.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p>I had now been in my second year of labor
for some months, during which I had
made some long journeys, and seen some
hard service.</p>

<p>I made an arrangement with Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, a
very intelligent gentleman whom I had employed
a few months before as a colporteur,
to accompany me. The whole tour required
us to travel near four hundred miles. More
than two thirds of the way the country was
wild and romantic, the population sparse and
rude. Few thought it safe to go unarmed.</p>

<p>On the day set I met Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; at C&mdash;&mdash;,
where he resided. To my surprise he had
provided a pistol for each of us. With some
persuasion I took one, but soon got it to the
bottom of my saddle-bags.</p>

<p>The first day we reached W&mdash;&mdash;, where we
found a young preacher who had been waiting
there some days for an escort over the
same route, fearing to travel the road alone.
We all started in company early the next
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
morning, with the understanding that we had
to reach G&mdash;&mdash;, a new county-town thirty
miles distant, or lodge in the woods. Nothing
special occurred that day, except that an
enormous rattlesnake crossed the road before
us and frightened our horses. We called
at the door of all the cabins we saw, and
preached Christ to the people, and gave them
books. We reached G&mdash;&mdash; late in the evening,
and found a pious lawyer who had just
moved there, and owned the only Bible in
the place. There were not a dozen families
in it. By breakfast-time the next morning
we had supplied him with a neat Sunday-school
library, which he used to great advantage.</p>

<p>We were told we must ride thirty-five miles
the next day, over mountain paths, to reach
a place of lodging&mdash;that there was one house
at thirty miles, but by all means to avoid
that house. The reasons I cannot give; nor
an account of the dinner we <i>tried to eat</i> that
day.</p>

<p>As the weather was excessively hot, we left
G&mdash;&mdash; by six in the morning. We soon overtook
a young man who was going some miles
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
our way, and agreed to be our guide as far
as we went together. We found him totally
ignorant of sin, or a future state. He did
not know whether he had ever seen a Bible
or not. Though he had heard men preach,
and seen them with a book in their hand, he
could not tell what book it was. He told us
his father was a county surveyor, and, he
thought, a member of the church. I gave
him a Testament and some tracts, which he
looked at with amazement.</p>

<p>About ten o’clock we came to a number of
men at work cutting timber out of the road,
that had been blown down by a storm. On
inquiry, we found eleven families represented,
only one of which had a Bible. One or two
others had lost their Bibles by having their
cabins burnt. We supplied all with books,
and left one or two reading for all the rest.</p>

<p>The want of dinner and the excessive heat
of the sun brought on me sick headache,
and by four or five o’clock I could scarcely
sit on my horse. I told my companions it
would be impossible for me to reach the
house we were directed to, and let the consequence
be what it would, I should be compelled
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
either to lie out, or lodge in the vile
den of which we had been warned. The
brethren seemed much alarmed, but said
they would not leave me. Several times I
had to alight, to prevent falling from my
horse. Being thus detained, we only reached
this dreaded place about sunset.</p>

<p>There was a very large grazing farm, and
a large double log-cabin about the centre,
with every appearance of plenty. As we drew
near the house we saw quite a number of men
at work haying in a large meadow. Every
one seemed to be drunk. Such swearing and
hallooing I had never heard. Our prospects
looked gloomy.</p>

<p>We rode up to the door, and found the
landlord under the same influence as those
in the field. When we asked for lodging he
seemed glad to have customers, and soon
had our horses cared for.</p>

<p>In a little time all the drunken rabble on
the place were gathered to the house, but
such a set of men I have never seen before
or since. Supper was soon ready, and all
invited in. The food was very rough, but
abundant. I was too sick to partake of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span></p>

<p>After supper I told the landlord that I was
very sick, and must go to bed; but as we
were all religious men, and accustomed to
pray in our families night and morning, if he
was willing, we would have prayers. The
very announcement produced silence in a
moment, as if some strange thing was about
to happen. I requested him to bring all into
the house that would come, and in a few minutes
the house was well filled. I called on
one of the brethren to read and pray; and
soon after I was in bed, unconscious of all
around me till morning, when I awoke as well
as usual.</p>

<p>As soon as we were dressed I called on the
old man to get our horses. “Oh no, you
must stay for breakfast, and pray again,”
said he. “Well,” said I, “if you will bring
all in to prayers now, we will attend to worship
with pleasure.” In a little time the whole
household was present. I read a portion of
Scripture, and made the most earnest exhortation
I could possibly do, and prayed. A
more solemn audience I never addressed.</p>

<p>As soon as breakfast was over, our horses
were ready, when I asked the old man for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
our bill. “Not one cent, sir,” said he; “you
have <i>prayed plenty</i> to pay for every thing you
got. Every time you come this way stop and
get all you want, and pray, and it sha’n’t cost
you a cent.” We supplied all present with a
book or tract, and left well pleased on the
whole with our visit.</p>

<p>During the day we called at all the cabins
on our way. At one I found a man who told
me he was seventy years old, had seldom
heard a sermon, but that he had felt much
concern about where he would be <i>in the next
world, if there was one</i>. He said he never
had a Bible, but would like to get one very
much. I gave him a Testament and tracts.
He seemed very thankful, and listened with
great attention to all I had time to say.</p>

<p>At another house the woman told me they
had a Bible, and plenty of religious books.
I asked to see what kind of books they were.
When she presented the stock, it consisted of
an old copy of the history of George Washington.
She believed it to be a Bible, as no
one about the house knew a letter.</p>

<p>The same day we met a very aged man
riding on a poor little pony, with a small
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
bag of meal under him. I handed him some
tracts, for which he was very thankful, when
the following dialogue occurred.</p>

<p>“Have you any preaching in this mountain
country?” “Sometimes we have.” “Are
you a professor of religion?” “Yes, I have
been a member of the church forty years.”
“How are you supplied with religious books?”
“Well, we <i>haven’t got none</i> but two or three
spelling-books that I sent for many years ago
to teach my children how to read.” “Have
you no Bible in your house?” “No, I never
had one. I have been trying to get a Testament
for some time at the store; but it costs
seventy-five cents, and I am not able to raise
the money.” This was the regular price of a
small Testament in that region at that time,
and seldom to be got even at that price.</p>

<p>Said I, “Is it not hard to live the life of a
Christian without the Bible?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” said he, “but I can’t help it; for
even if I was able to buy one, it could not be
got nearer than C&mdash;&mdash;, which is forty miles
distant. I never expect to be rich enough to
buy a whole Bible.”</p>

<p>My soul was stirred within me, and I drew
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
out my pocket Bible, a fine copy which I had
received as a present, and gave it to him.
He looked for a moment at me with surprise,
when the tears gushed from his eyes,
and he exclaimed, “I am now rich and happy.”
This man was seventy-five years old,
and trembling on the brink of the grave.
This is a true picture of many cases found
by colporteurs. I never felt so well paid or
so happy as when I gave that man my only
Bible.</p>

<p>During this whole tour of five weeks’ travel,
many a scene similar to those described occurred;
while, on the other hand, I visited
villages and towns where I found fine
churches and able ministers, with highly cultivated
pious congregations. In this tour I
raised over $500 in donations, and employed
three excellent colporteurs, one of whom labored
nine years. I met the most cordial
co&ouml;peration from Christians and philanthropists
everywhere I went. All said, “This is
just what we need in this sparsely populated
mountain country.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</h2>

<p>While on this tour I visited the town of
L&mdash;&mdash;, near the centre of Western Virginia,
and made arrangements to remove there in a
few weeks. There are few towns of the size
which I have ever visited where I have met
with a more noble people. There was wealth,
intelligence, and the highest degree of refinement.
This town became the centre of my
operations for three years.</p>

<p>The distance we had to go in moving there
was about one hundred and fifty miles, up
and down mountains most of the way, with
scarce any thing like a road in many places:
a family of five, two of them children, in a
one-horse carriage, with the necessary equipage
for such a journey.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the third day we began
to ascend the Cheat mountain, which required
nine miles travelling to reach its summit, and
eight miles down the other side to its base,
with only one house all the way, and that on
the top of the mountain, called at that time
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
“the mountain house of entertainment.” It
was a large rude log-house, without comfort.
By the time we reached the top of it I found
my horse very much fatigued, and the sun
about setting. We concluded we could not descend
the mountain that night with safety, as
there was no moon, and the whole way was
through a dense pine forest.</p>

<p>When we came to this house on the very
top of the mountain, we found a number of
covered wagons that belonged to families
moving westward, and a crowd of people
of all colors about the house. I asked for
lodging. “Yes,” said the landlord, “lodging
plenty!” My family went into the house,
and I went to see my horse taken care of.
On my return I found them without any place
to sit down. After looking through the house,
and finding but two or three apartments, and
such a crowd of people, I asked the landlord
how he would lodge us all. “Oh,” said he,
“you can lie down a few at a time, and soon
as you get asleep I can stand you up against
the wall.”</p>

<p>Though it was in September, and very
warm in the valleys, yet it was cold on the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
top of this mountain, and we were all shivering.
I asked the landlord, who by this time
was playing the violin for our entertainment,
to make us a little fire. But there was neither
wood nor supper. The females were
stowed away in one room for the night, and
the rest lay on the floor or sat by turns till
the morning came.</p>

<p>As we had no toilet to make in the morning,
we were on the way down the mountain
at an early hour. The first house we reached
was a log-house, where they kept entertainment.
All was neat and clean. We called
for breakfast; and while it was preparing, we
had our morning devotions, which had been
noticed by the landlady. When we came to
our excellent breakfast, she asked me to christen
her children, of which she had quite a
number. I told her I was not a preacher,
and had no authority to administer ordinances.
She insisted most earnestly that I
must do it; that no one had ever prayed there
before, and she did not see any reason why
any praying man could not christen children;
that they had been living there for years, and
never heard a sermon or seen a preacher as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
they knew of; and if I would only do it, they
would not charge me one cent for breakfast.
After preaching them the best sermon I could,
and giving a good supply of little books, we
went on our way. In two more days we
reached L&mdash;&mdash;, our place of destination, in
safety, and in a few hours had a house rented
and were living in it.</p>

<p>For three years I travelled almost constantly;
sometimes in a buggy, but mostly
on horseback, making from six to eight thousand
miles each year, distributing tracts and
books in cabins and mansions, collecting
money, and employing men, till I had the cooperation
of <i>over fifty colporteurs</i>. The many
interesting facts and incidents which occurred
during these years would fill a large volume.
A very few of them I shall attempt to relate.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>A Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, whom we had employed for
some years, a man of much more than ordinary
piety and qualifications for the work,
while visiting in the mountains, came to a
poor cabin occupied by a man, his wife, and
an only son. They were very poor. The
father made his living by grubbing, and took
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
the boy with him to pick the brush, he being
at this time about sixteen years old. They
carried home their wages on their backs,
mostly in some kind of food. The mother
made what she earned by her spinning-wheel;
and while at that, had taught her
son to read the Testament, though she was
not religious. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, after talking and
praying with them, gave this boy a copy of
Baxter’s Call, which was the means of his
conversion. Before he could join the church,
the neighbors aided in getting him a suit of
clothes.</p>

<p>He immediately set about to improve himself
in every possible way. There was no
school near; and if there had been, he had
no means to go. His first efforts in learning
to write were, by copying the letters out of a
book with his finger in the snow. He borrowed
and read all the books he could get,
and attended a little church where there was
preaching once each month.</p>

<p>About two years afterwards I received a
letter by some private way from this same
boy, D. W. S&mdash;&mdash;. On opening it, I made
out its contents with some difficulty. It was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
an application to become a colporteur. In
the letter he referred me to the Rev. Mr.
R&mdash;&mdash;, who lived in town. I went to him,
showed him the letter, and asked him if he
knew the writer. He laughed: “Yes, very
well; I received him into the church. D&mdash;&mdash;
is a good boy, but he is without education,
and knows nothing of the world; he has never
been ten miles from home in his life.”</p>

<p>I wrote the young man a kind letter, saying
I hoped he would make a colporteur some
day, and advised him to go to school a while.</p>

<p>The next thing I heard from him was a rap
at my door. When I opened the door, an
awkward-looking youth near six feet high
stood before me, with the same suit of clothes
on him he had got over two years before.
The pants were several inches too short, and
the coat-sleeves as deficient; indeed, the coat
was little more than a big patch on his back.
Said he, “I am the <i>fellow</i> that wrote you a
letter about wanting to <i>colport</i>, and I have
come to see about it.” I invited him into the
house. He was all in a tremor of excitement.
When I opened the parlor door he looked in
with amazement, and in walking to a seat
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
avoided stepping on the white spots in the
carpet, which was the first one he ever saw.
He was so embarrassed he could scarcely
speak.</p>

<p>After talking a little while about crops, etc.,
he became composed. He then told me his
desires to do good, and all about his conversion,
which was entirely satisfactory. As it
was late in the evening, I invited him to stay
for the night; and by the time we got his
poor old pony of a horse, not worth five dollars,
put away, tea was ready. When he sat
down he looked confused. I had much conversation
with him that evening. At length
I invited him up stairs to bed. On the way
up he held by the railing to avoid treading
on the narrow carpet in the centre.</p>

<p>In the morning he was up whistling psalm
tunes bright and early. As soon as I was
dressed I called him and told him I had reflected
over the matter very carefully, and
had come to the conclusion that his want of
education and knowledge of the world would
not justify me in employing him.</p>

<p>I saw his countenance change in a moment
and the tears start in his eyes. “Oh,” said
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
he, “<i>I do want you to give me work, for I
do feel that all I want to live for is to work for
Christ.</i>”</p>

<p>I cannot describe my feelings as he uttered
these words. Here was a depth of devotion
beyond any thing I had met. After some
minutes’ silence I said to him, “There is a
region of country on the head-waters of the
Elk river where there never has been any
preaching; if you will go there a month without
any commission, I will see you are paid.”</p>

<p>His countenance was changed in a moment,
and lit up with joy. In less than two hours
I had a pair of colporteur’s saddle-bags filled
with books and tracts, and he was on his
journey to that destitute region, some forty
miles distant. Soon after, some stock raisers
who had been in that region buying cattle,
told me they heard that the Tract Society
had a great man out there; that the people
were wonderfully pleased with him; that he
was giving them books, and teaching them to
read them.</p>

<p>At the end of the month he returned, all
his stock had passed into the hands of the
people, and he gave me a glowing account of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
the people’s wants and his success. He said
it would take another month to get over that
region, and he wanted to go back. After
aiding him to dispense with his boy clothes, I
started him with another load of books, cautioning
him to avoid showing off his new suit
as much as possible.</p>

<p>Another month’s work was done with great
success, when he returned almost a new boy
in his whole appearance. He had gained
confidence by being constantly among people
that did not know as much as he did.</p>

<p>I then had him commissioned for P&mdash;&mdash;
county, a very mountainous region, and very
destitute of the means of moral improvement.
In a few months he had visited every family
in the county. In many families the bare
mention of his name will start tears in the
eyes of the people, and the tracts that he distributed
have been sewed together and covered
with deerskin as remembrances of the
man that left them.</p>

<p>Often through the day when he would
come in sight of a cabin, he would alight
from his horse and kneel in the woods and
plead with God for success in his visit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<p>He next visited the counties of M&mdash;&mdash; and
R&mdash;&mdash;, two large counties, with remarkable
success. By this time he became a fine-looking
young man, and by his constant application
to reading the books as he rode along,
he had become an intelligent, spiritual Christian.</p>

<p>We then sent him to the large county of
P&mdash;&mdash;, where there was in portions of it a
high degree of intelligence and refinement.</p>

<p>In a few months he was licensed to preach
the gospel. He married a lady of high moral
worth, and settled in the county of H&mdash;&mdash;
over four weak churches. In two and a half
years he received over two hundred persons
into the church on profession of their faith;
then took typhoid fever, with which he soon
died in the triumphs of a living faith.</p>

<p>Since his death I have met with five young
men, who are now ministers of the gospel,
who had been led to Christ by his labors, all
of whom speak of him as an extraordinary
man in point of piety and usefulness.</p>

<p>Here was a boy that in all probability
would have lived and died in ignorance and
sin if he had not been found by a colporteur.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
He has often put his hand on my shoulder,
and said with tears in his eyes, “Brother
C&mdash;&mdash;, if it had not been for the Tract Society,
I should have been a poor grubber to-day, on
the way to death and ruin.”</p>

<p>The great secret of his success was his untiring
zeal and industry. He read and studied
on his saddle; the shades of the forest
were his closet in the summer, and the cleft
of some mountain rock in the winter. His
congregations were mostly ignorant families,
and his rostrum a three-legged stool in the
corner. All his talents were put to use in
the Lord’s work, and no doubt he has his
reward. Reader, go thou and do likewise,
and receive a like gracious reward.</p>

<p>On a Saturday evening while on my way
to meet a Sabbath appointment, while descending
a mountain, I met a man on his
way home from mill, and offered him some
tracts. “Oh,” said he, “they are of no use
to me, for I can’t read, and I have no one
about me that can.” I asked him if he had
a family. “Yes, I have a wife and seven
children.” “It is a great sin,” said I, “for
you to raise a family in such ignorance.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
“Oh,” said he, “there is so much harm in
books, they are better without them.” I
handed him two or three tracts, and told him
to get some one to read them to him. One of
them was, Fifty Reasons for Attending Public
Worship. He took them, and when he got
home showed them to his wife. “Oh,” said
she, “we will be ruined now. I’ll bet that is
a warrant that Middleton has got the sheriff
to serve on you, and we will lose our land.”
They spent a sleepless night, and early next
morning they went to the nearest neighbor
and told him they had got into sad trouble
about their land; that Middleton had served
a warrant on them, and here it was.</p>

<p>The tracts were presented to a man who
was a class-leader in the Methodist church,
and was my informer near a year after this
occurrence. He took the first one, “Fifty
Reasons for Attending Public Worship.”
“Well,” said he, “this is a warrant, but not
sent by Middleton, but from the court of heaven.
God has sent you this, as you never go
to church; and now you see how you have
exposed your ignorance by not being able to
read, not knowing the difference between a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
sheriff’s writ and a religious tract; and I do
hope you will now attend church, and have
your children taught to read.” “Now,” said
my informer, “this man and his wife are both
members of the church, and they are sending
their children to school as the result of the
influence of those tracts.”</p>

<p>On one occasion I left home by a stage-coach
before daylight on a long journey.
We stopped after ten miles to take other
passengers. As usual, the way-bill was taken
into the stage-office to enter their names. A
man was in the office who had travelled near
one hundred miles to see me at L&mdash;&mdash;. Seeing
my name on the way-bill, he asked if that
was the man that was the <i>tract</i> agent. About
that time I stepped in to warm myself and
distribute tracts, when some one acquainted
with me told him I was the agent. He then
told me how far he had come to see me, and
how near he was to miss me, all the time interlarding
his conversation with oaths, to the
great amazement of all present who knew the
nature of my work. When he was through,
I told him I would tell him the nature of the
work in a few words: that he must get a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
good horse and a large pair of saddle-bags,
fill them with books, and ride over these rugged
mountains, and live on hard fare. With
an awful oath he said he could stand all that
with any fellow about the diggins. In addition
to that, said I, you must read the
Bible, and pray at every house. I never
saw a man so utterly confounded, while those
present were convulsed with laughter. I
gave him a few tracts, and talked to him
till he wept like a child. Although I never
heard of the man again, I have hope that the
conversation was not in vain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XII">CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p>About this time I held a Colporteur Convention
in C&mdash;&mdash;, in which a number of colporteurs
were present. The meeting was one
of deep interest. Many facts were brought
out in relation to the wants of that region,
and the good resulting from the work, that
were of the most cheering character.</p>

<p>During the three days of our meetings, an
old man was present who was but little known
to any that were there. When about to close
the convention, I said that if any one present
wished to give us a word of advice or exhortation
we should be glad to hear it, when
this old man rose, trembling with diffidence,
and said:</p>

<p>“As soon as I heard of this meeting I made
up my mind to attend it; and now I want to
tell you what this Society has done for me.
My name is C&mdash;&mdash;. Ten years ago I was
considered the wickedest man in this county.
I was a profane drunkard. One day while at
S&mdash;&mdash;, about four miles above this place, old
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;, who was always distributing
tracts, handed me one with the word <i>Eternity</i>
in large letters at the head of it. I was the
worse for liquor at the time, and on my horse
to go home, which was about fifteen miles
distant. On my way I took the tract out of
my hat to read it. My attention got fixed
on the word <i>Eternity</i>, and I became alarmed
about my state as a sinner. By the time I
got home I was nearly sober. I read and
reread the tract till I had it committed to
memory. For near two weeks I had no rest.
At last my distress became so great that I
did not want to live. One day I was tempted
to go away to the woods and destroy myself.
While there I thought of praying, for the
first time, and fell down on my knees and
cried, ‘God be merciful to me a sinner.’ In
a moment I felt relief, and went home with
a joyful heart, and told my family all about
the matter. I read the tract to them, and
began to pray with and for them. In six
months I had a little church built on my land,
and a missionary there to preach once each
month, and myself, wife, and six of my children
and eight servants were members of it;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
and here is five dollars, all the money I have
in the world, to aid in giving good books to
others.” All present were bathed in tears at
this recital.</p>

<p>As soon as he was seated, another man
arose and said “he supposed all present had
heard of Father B&mdash;&mdash;, who died a few weeks
ago, and many, no doubt, remember when he
was a terror in the community. He had remarkable
bodily powers, and could whip any
man in all the country round. When the
county of L&mdash;&mdash; was laid off, there was a violent
contest about where to build the court-house;
and the two parties agreed that B&mdash;&mdash;
and another bully should decide the matter
by a fist-fight, and B&mdash;&mdash; gained the site
where that court-house now stands. He was
often brought up at the court for assault and
battery, and had crippled some men for life.
Judge S&mdash;&mdash; on one occasion, when passing
sentence on him, said, ‘B&mdash;&mdash;, you have become
too bad a man to live, and if ever you
come before me again convicted of crime, I
will make you suffer for it most severely. If
you would improve the mind God has given
you, you might be a blessing to the world;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
but now you are a disgrace. Here is a tract,
‘The Fool’s Pence;’ take and read it, and
may God lead you by it to be a better man.’
That tract was the means of his conversion,
and for the last fifteen years of his life he
was one of the most successful preachers in
South-western Virginia.”</p>

<p>Another fact was brought out at this meeting
by the Rev. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, who labored for
some time as a colporteur in the county of
W&mdash;&mdash;. He entered a large settlement where
there never had been any preaching, schools,
or distribution of books. The Sabbath was
the special day for frolicking and dissipation.
In the house where he lodged on Saturday
night, the family were busy preparing to go
to a shooting-match the next morning. All
he could say had no effect on them. After
praying God to guide him in his duty, he
determined to go with them. When they
came to the place, a large collection of all
classes were present, with a great number of
articles to gamble for in different ways. He
told them, as it was the Lord’s day, he would
unite with them in prayer for God’s blessing.
He prayed earnestly, and then told them that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
if they would give him their attention he
would preach to them. They seemed confounded
at this remark, and all remained
silent as death. He announced his text, and
preached with unusual liberty. The attention
was solemn, and they looked at one another
with amazement. He then distributed
among them his remaining stock of books
and tracts, and as he was very unwell, went
home. Soon after the news spread that some
people in that region were concerned about
their souls. A preacher visited them, and
soon had a good congregation gathered, and
over twenty converts. Sunday frolicking was
abandoned, and many were led to observe
the Lord’s day.</p>

<p>The same man stated another fact, which
occurred in J&mdash;&mdash; county. While visiting in
one of those sparsely populated regions, he
came to a very large farm. He found the
family to consist of the father, mother, and
twelve children, the youngest about eight
years old. The man was wealthy in land
and stock, but to his surprise no one knew a
letter in a book. After talking to them about
their relations to God and eternity, he asked
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the father why he did not have his children
taught to read. The old objection was raised
at once, that they learned enough of <i>bad</i> without
books; that he had got along very well
without reading, and so could his children.</p>

<p>He then began to read to them, showed
them the pictures in the Alphabet of Animals,
and read them some account of them. Several
of the children said, “Oh, I wish I could
read.” He then gave them one or two books
and some tracts. A few months after he was
coming back the same way, and called to pay
another visit. “Well,” said the old man, “you
have give me a <i>purty lot of trouble by leaving
them books here</i>. I had no peace till I got a
man to come and <i>larn</i> them to read them.”
So sure enough the teacher was there, and
now they bought more books freely.</p>

<p>In travelling through a wild mountain region,
where I was a total stranger, I came to
a small village of about a dozen houses, with
a little store and tavern. Before I reached
it, I heard men hallooing in the most boisterous
manner. When I drove up weary to the
public-house, I was surrounded with such a
set of savage-looking men as I never had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
seen before, and all intoxicated. Every man
had on a hunting-shirt, with a belt round him,
to which hung a long butcher-knife. I felt
afraid of the men, I must confess, and would
have been glad to have been elsewhere, especially
as my buggy and trunk seemed to attract
rather too much attention.</p>

<p>After I had got food for myself and horse,
and laid round some tracts as quietly as possible,
I started, hoping to reach a point near
twenty miles distant that night. Some part
of the way I was told the road was very
good, but mostly rough and mountainous.</p>

<p>As soon as I was out of sight, I drove rapidly,
and made the first five miles in an hour,
when I began to breathe easier.</p>

<p>But all at once I heard the most unearthly
yelling behind me that had ever greeted my
ears. My horse was frightened, and tried to
run off. In a few moments I heard the clatter
of horses’ feet, and concluded all was over
with me. In a moment I was surrounded
with some eight or ten of the most desperate
looking men, and told to stop; that they
wanted to know what I was loaded with. I
told them I was loaded with good religious
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
books, which I was distributing among people
that had none. I was then ordered to
give them all up to them, and they would
scatter them on the other side of the mountain,
for there were no books over there. I
told them I knew they were too generous to
take all that I had.</p>

<p>I then told them to listen to me, and I
would tell them what the books taught. So
I began and preached them the most earnest
sermon that I ever preached. One of them
said, “Give me your hand, sir, for I never
had a preacher by the hand in my life.” I
held his hand firmly, and preached on, although
the muzzle of his gun was frequently
in very dangerous proximity to my person.</p>

<p>It was evident they began to feel uneasy
under my wayside sermon, and for fear they
would leave me without tracts, I began the
distribution, and gave each one a number of
the most suitable I could find. They invited
me to come over the mountains and preach,
and I would get plenty to come and hear me.
Some of those tracts were found more than a
year after by one of our colporteurs, carefully
preserved and highly prized.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIII">CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p>Another case that seemed more threatening
than the last mentioned, occurred soon
after in the county of G&mdash;&mdash;. I was on my
way to meet a Sabbath appointment. About
two o’clock I came to a river which was
much swollen by the late rains. The man
who kept the ferry-boat lived on the opposite
side of the river, where some four or five men
were pitching quoits and making a great
noise. I called a number of times before
they even condescended to answer me; and
when they did answer, it was with curses,
telling me they would come when they were
ready. I had then sixteen miles to go to
B&mdash;&mdash;, the place where I expected to lodge.
They kept me waiting two hours before they
came with the boat, consequently it was late
when I got over. They were drunk and very
profane, charged me four prices, and cursed
me for troubling them. I gave them some
tracts, and the best advice I could.</p>

<p>Soon after I met two women: one seemed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
to be about thirty, and the other sixty years
old. I offered them some tracts, which they
at first declined, for fear I might be the sheriff.
Neither knew a letter, or could tell who
was the Saviour of sinners.</p>

<p>Soon after I passed them a terrible rain
came on, and the roads were so deep my
horse could scarcely draw my buggy. I saw
night would soon overtake me, and the prospect
of lodging looked unfavorable. I stopped
at a cabin by the roadside to inquire the
way, and leave some tracts. A man came out
who looked as if he was ready for any crime,
and came right up to my buggy, and began
to look in with a scrutinizing eye. He either
could not or would not give me any satisfaction
about the road. After an earnest exhortation
about his soul, I gave him Baxter’s
Call. All the conduct of the man was of a
very suspicious character.</p>

<p>It was now late, and raining hard, and in a
little time would be very dark. I drove on
as fast as possible, until it began to get quite
dark, when I met a man on the road walking;
whether he was a white man or not, I could
not tell. I stopped him to inquire if there
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
was any place near where I could lodge. He
immediately began to examine the inside of
my buggy as fully as the darkness would permit.
He told me there was a man on the
other bank of the creek, about half a mile
ahead of me, who kept lodgers, and that it
was a good place to stop. I handed him
a book and thanked him, and drove on, he
following a short distance, asking me questions
which were not calculated to allay my
anxiety.</p>

<p>I soon reached the creek, which seemed to
be very high and rapid, and it was so dark I
could see no object on the other side of it.
The road entered by a narrow ravine, and
there was no way to back out. I lifted my
heart to God for protection, and drove in.
In a moment the water was up in my buggy,
but thanks to God, I got through safely, and
in a few moments my horse was standing by
the door of a miserable cabin.</p>

<p>I called, and a man came out with a torch
of pine-knots in his hand. He was both dirty
and ragged. I asked him where the man
lived that kept lodgers. “Oh,” said he, “I
am the man that keeps tavern here.” My
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
prospects were bad, but I could get no further.
I asked him to put up my tired horse
and feed him. He had no stable but a rail-pen,
no feed but some sheaves of green
wheat. He took me to another cabin about
fifty yards distant, that was as dark as a dungeon,
except so far as his torch gave us light.
Although it was warm, I requested him to
make me a fire, which he did with reluctance.</p>

<p>After some time I was invited to the first
cabin to supper. The man and his wife and
children, as well as the supper, were all dirty
in the extreme. I attempted to eat, but in
vain. As soon as the man finished his meal,
we returned to the other cabin, where I conversed
with him. He was a total stranger to
the simplest truths of the Bible.</p>

<p>I asked him if he knew any thing of the
celebrated Lucas family of that county. “Oh
yes,” said he, “they live all round here. Did
you not meet a man as you came along to-night
about the top of the hill over the creek?”
I said yes. “Well, that was one of them, and
I wonder they let you pass so late in the
evening. That one, and the one that lived in
the house you last passed were the two implicated
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
in killing the man for which one of their
uncles was hung at Giles court-house, and if
I had given in my testimony, they would
have been hung too; and I am afraid they
will kill me, because I know all about it.”</p>

<p>By this time I was considerably alarmed.
The conclusion I came to was that they were
all linked together, and that I was in the
slaughter-house.</p>

<p>I then inquired all about old Randal Lucas,
who was the father of two that had been
hung, and some others that were in prison,
and was the grandfather of the two he had
just been telling me about. He gave me a
full history of the old man, much of which
cannot be told. “But,” said he, “such a man
you never saw. He is ninety years old. When
he puts on a suit of clothes, he never takes it
off till it is worn out. In the winter he lies
in the ashes, and in the summer he lies down
in the mire like a hog.” This is confirmed
in Howe’s History of Virginia, which relates
how he sat under the gallows eating gingerbread
while his sons were hung. I refer the
reader to that history for an account of this
wonderful man and his family.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p>The manner in which he told the whole
story was any thing but pleasant to me. He
began to get sleepy, and told me he would
hold the pine-light while I got into bed up on
the <i>loft</i>, as he called it. The only way to get
up was by a ladder made of a pole split
in two, with rounds put into it. I climbed
up, and he followed me with the torch. As
soon as I got to the bed over the loose boards
that covered the floor, and found an old split-bottom
chair, which I expected to use in self-defence
before morning, I told him to withdraw.</p>

<p>I lay down without undressing, after committing
my soul, family, and all my interests
to God, without much hope of seeing the
light of another day. No one occupied the
house but myself as a bedroom. I kept
watch till morning, and when any unpleasant
sound was heard, I made noise enough to let
any one approaching know that I was awake.</p>

<p>As soon as it was light I was up to see to
my poor horse, which was standing in mud
and water six inches deep, without food.
After getting him some more green wheat in
the sheaf, and a little corn bread for myself,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
and talking and praying with the family, I
left them. I cannot say whether there was
any intention to rob me or take my life. I
hope there was not.</p>

<p>When I was about two miles on my way,
and was rising a mountain where the road
was scarcely six inches wider than my buggy,
a man met me, riding a poor old horse without
a saddle, all in rags and dirt, with nothing
on him but remnants of a torn shirt and
pants, with a rope tied round his waist, and
a bottle of whiskey in his bosom. Such a
looking piece of humanity I had never seen
before. In a moment I concluded this is
certainly old Randal Lucas. I saw he could
not pass me on that narrow road, and I determined
to have a full talk with him. When
we met he tried to keep the upper side of the
road, and get between my horse and the steep
bank.</p>

<p>“Good morning, sir,” said I. “Good morning,”
said he, in a very unnatural tone of
voice. “Don’t you want some good books
to read this morning?” “No, I don’t want
any; I can’t read.” “Do you go to church?”
“No, I don’t care about church.” “Well,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
sir,” said I, “you are an old man and must
soon go to the other world.” “Yes, I am
ninety years old.” “Is it possible,” said I,
“you are so old?” “Yes, I can prove it.”
“You would find but few witnesses to prove
that by.” “Well, I can swear it then.”
“Well, sir,” said I, “what do you think will
become of you when you die?” “O well, I
<i>doesn’t</i> care any thing about that.” “Can
you tell me who is the Saviour of sinners?”
“I don’t know any thing of <i>them</i> things.”
“Well, sir, who made you?” “Why, I suppose
it was God Almighty.” “What is your
name, sir?” “Randal Lucas.” “Well,” said
I, “I thought so,” straightening myself with
a determined look. “Well, sir, you say you
don’t go to church, and I must tell you in
the name of my Master, that if you don’t repent
you will soon be in hell. I have read
and heard of you, sir, for years, and you
stand on the brink of eternal burnings, and
your soul stained with every crime that a
man could commit.” He began to look frightened,
and tried to pass me; but I kept my
position, and for some minutes laid down the
terrors of the law in the strongest language
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
I could use, and then gave him some little
books and tracts. He trembled like an aspen
leaf.</p>

<p>A few weeks afterwards he took up the
idea that he was soon to die, got a coffin
made, tried it to see if it would fit, paid for
it, and set it up in his cabin&mdash;sent for a
preacher, told him he was going to die and
did not know what would become of him,
and asked him to pray for him; offered him
fifty cents, and said, “Pray on till my money
is done.” The money was of course refused.
In a few days the poor wretch died as he
had lived, leaving a host of children the descendants
of unnatural and brutal connection.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIV">CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p>Travelling in a mountainous region at
nightfall of a tempestuous day, and having
lost my road, I was directed for a lodging
to “Squire D&mdash;&mdash;’s, who keeps the ferry.”
After supper, I had a pleasant talk with the
father of Squire D&mdash;&mdash;, on whose head the
snows of eighty winters had fallen, and soon
the family were gathered round us, engaged
in delightful converse. I inquired as to the
high-handed wickedness of a neighborhood
not far off, where I had heard that meetings
were frequently held in mockery of religious
worship:</p>

<p>“Yes, yes,” said the squire, with just
enough of the Welsh accent to betray his
origin, “and our neighborhood here was just
as bad ten years ago; we were all alike: no
church, no preacher, no Sunday-school, no
day-school. One evening a minister and a
young lady stopped at my house for the
night; I thought them very inquisitive people.
They asked if we had any preaching.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
‘No.’ Any schools? ‘No; we have had several
teachers, but no one will stay more than
a quarter with us.’ The young lady said she
would come and take a school among us, if
we would employ her. After some further
conversation, I told her I would see what
could be done, and write her the result. Next
morning they left for the minister’s home at
M&mdash;&mdash;, some fifty miles distant.</p>

<p>“In a short time I had a school made up
and board engaged for the new teacher, and
wrote her to that effect. She came and commenced
her school at the time appointed.
But soon there was complaint that the new
teacher <i>read the Bible and prayed in her school</i>.
And her troubles did not cease here. The
man at whose house she boarded insisted that
she should leave, because she prayed, sung
hymns, and would keep talking about religion
all the time. Miss H&mdash;&mdash; then set out to
look up another home for herself; but she
met the same reply from all: ‘We cannot receive
you unless you leave off praying and
singing.’</p>

<p>“When she applied to me, I objected on
the same grounds. Finally, I told her if she
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
would come on my own terms, I would take
her into my family. She inquired what those
terms were. ‘Why,’ said I, ‘you shall have
such a room to yourself; there you are to
stay from the time you return from school
until you start to go back, only when you
come to your meals: you must not sing
hymns; you may pray as much as you please,
but mind you don’t let us hear you at it; and
<i>remember</i>, the first time you infringe this contract,
you leave the premises.’ To all this
she agreed, with as much meekness as if my
terms had been reasonable and right. That
evening she took up her abode under my
roof; and little did I think what a blessing
God was sending me in that frail, delicate
girl.</p>

<p>“The children all loved the new teacher
very much. So one day she told them to ask
their parents’ permission, and if <i>they</i> were
agreed, she would teach them on Sunday too.
This proposal pleased us all. If she taught
on Sunday, that was so much clear gain to
us.</p>

<p>“I soon observed that my children took to
staying in the teacher’s room much of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
time. At length, one Sunday morning, they
came down with some tracts; I looked over
them, and found they were on the subject of
religion. Ah, said I, my lady, I’ve caught
you now. I called her down, told her she
had violated her contract, and must be off.
The poor girl began to weep; I felt ashamed.
‘Dear sir,’ said she, ‘will you read those
tracts? If you do, and still continue in your
present mind, I will leave your house immediately.’</p>

<p>“Here was a pretty fix; the children were
all crying, and begging me not to send Miss
H&mdash;&mdash; away; and the books, Oh, they could
not part with the books. I was mightily
perplexed; at last I gave in. Said I, ‘Miss
H&mdash;&mdash;, you may go back to your room; I will
consider the matter.’ I shall never forget the
smile that passed over her face as she thanked
me and went back to her room. Thanked
me, indeed! Well, I set to work, read one
of the tracts, felt self-condemned; read it
again, felt dreadfully troubled. Then I read
them all, and felt that I was a great sinner.
I said nothing more to Miss H&mdash;&mdash; about
leaving my house. Each day my convictions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
became deeper. At last, I could bear it no
longer. Thought I, this won’t do; I must
talk with Miss H&mdash;&mdash;. So I invited her to
come and sit with us in the family. She
cheerfully complied. I asked her a great
many questions about the doctrines of the
Bible, not meaning to let her know any thing
about my concern. But all would not do;
my distress continued, or rather my agony,
for I thought I was the greatest sinner on
earth.</p>

<p>“At last, I sent one evening for Miss H&mdash;&mdash;
to come down, and I told her my troubles;
for my proud heart was well-nigh broken.
Said I, Miss H&mdash;&mdash;, I feel so and so ever
since I read those tracts of yours; and I related
all that was passing in my mind; and,
said I, do you think there is any mercy or
hope for such a poor miserable sinner? The
tears began to run down her cheeks; then
she laughed; then she caught me by both
hands, and looking up into my face, she said,
‘Oh, my dear friend, I am <i>so</i> glad.’ ‘Why,’
said I, ‘are you glad because I am in trouble?’
‘Oh, my dear sir,’ says she, ‘this is the Spirit
of God operating on your heart.’ All at once
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
a great light seemed to shine into my mind.
All that I had been learning for so many
weeks seemed now just as plain as A B C.
Said I, ‘Come, Miss H&mdash;&mdash;, kneel down then
and pray for me;’ and she did pray for me,
and I do bless God for his wonderful mercy
to such a poor hardened sinner. I believe
that God <i>did</i> change my heart just while that
<i>very prayer</i> was going up. All at once it just
came: I loved my Bible and I loved to pray,
and I could not bear the company that I used
to take so much delight in.</p>

<p>“On the next Sabbath, Miss H&mdash;&mdash; asked
me to go along with her and the children to
the school&mdash;which was, and had been a Sunday-school,
though we never suspected it;
and here came a trial. If I go, they will say
I am getting religious; if I stay, it will be a
sin, for I know I <i>ought</i> to go; and then it
will grieve Miss H&mdash;&mdash;. These last considerations
were the strongest; so I went. The
room was crowded with children, all waiting
for their teacher; I thought they all looked
happy. After a little while, Miss H&mdash;&mdash; took
the Bible, and coming to me, she said, ‘Mr.
D&mdash;&mdash;, will you read and pray with us this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
morning?’ I was startled; my very heart
trembled. Said I, ‘Oh no; not now.’ Then
she read a chapter and prayed herself. Oh,
how I felt, to think that I was ashamed to
pray before those children! Ah, thought I,
this will never do; I will come here and pray
next Sunday. That night I read and prayed
with my family; and the next Sabbath I
opened the school with prayer.</p>

<p>“The news spread soon all through the
settlement. D&mdash;&mdash; has got religion and is
praying in the Sunday-school! strange news
this! Very soon the people began to drop
into our Sunday-school. Then Miss H&mdash;&mdash;
said to me, ‘You had better read us a sermon
at the Sunday-school, after the other
exercises are over.’ She selected the sermons,
and I read them. Our meetings grew
very solemn. Presently we sent word to a
good man at B&mdash;&mdash; to send us a minister; he
did so. The minister came and preached for
us. The little school-house could not contain
one half of the people who crowded to
hear him. We held our meetings in the open
air, under the trees.</p>

<p>“Ah, that was a wonderful time; the cry
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
of the anxious sinner went up from every
house. The Spirit of God was moving mightily
upon the hearts of the people, and many
were born into the kingdom of Christ. All
this brought a great change in our settlement.
Instead of the dance, and the gaming-table,
and the foolish song, we had meetings for
prayer and praise; and the tavern and still-house
were exchanged for the temple of
God.</p>

<p>“The Sabbath became a day of holy rest
among a people who used to spend it in revelry
or idleness. Houses of worship were
built, where our population flocked every
Sabbath to hear the preached word from the
living minister; and in the course of two
or three years, hundreds professed faith in
Christ, and joined the church. We have had
a flourishing church here ever since. Ah,”
said the good man, in his peculiarly emphatic
way, “see what God hath wrought for us.”</p>

<p>How often have I reproached myself, when
I contrasted the heroic conduct of this devoted
female with my own man-fearing spirit!
She has gone to her reward; her memory will
be cherished for a few more years in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
hearts of those to whom her humble efforts
were of such immense value, and then pass
away and be forgotten. But her <i>influence</i>
will pass on, an ever-increasing current, down
the long tracts of time, and throughout the
endless ages of eternity.

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XV">CHAPTER XV.</h2>

<p>The latter part of the year 1848 was spent
laboring in South-western Virginia. I visited
several towns as a colporteur, taking with me
some applicant for this service, to give him a
favorable introduction to his labors.</p>

<p>I reached the beautiful town of A&mdash;&mdash; late
in the evening, an entire stranger, and stopped
at a hotel, wet, cold, and hungry. About the
same time the stage arrived with a number of
passengers, and we all asked for rooms with
fire in them. While this was preparing I
stepped into the bar-room, the only place
where I could find a fire; but it had been
election day, and such a company of intoxicated
men I had never seen in one room.
Several of them were lying on the floor, unable
to rise; and the swearing was awful. I
immediately began the distribution of tracts
and little paper-covered books; and among
them I laid down a copy of “Universalism
not of God.” As I passed round, laying them
down on chairs and tables, as well as handing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
them to the men, I observed a very fine-looking
man who had come in the stage, following
me, and looking at them.</p>

<p>As I laid down “Universalism not of God,”
he took it up, and said to me very abruptly
that the book was a libel on the Universalists.
“Oh,” said I, “I understand the cause of
your objection to the book. You are one of
those who believe that thieves, murderers,
and liars all go to heaven; that there is no
such place as hell.” “Yes,” said he, “I have
too good an opinion of God’s mercy to believe
there is any such place as hell.” When he
made that remark, one of the fellows who was
lying drunk on the floor raised his head and
said, “You are a liar;” while another said
he “wished that was true, but there was no
such good news.” Said I, “Sir, I will hand
you over to these men, and you and they may
settle the controversy.” He immediately disappeared
from the room.</p>

<p>During my stay of three weeks in this beautiful
town, I visited every family in it, and
either sold or gave books.</p>

<p>One day I stepped into the office of a lawyer,
who was one of the first men in the state
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
in his profession. I offered him a copy of
Nelson on Infidelity. Said he, “I could not
take time to read a book of that size, except
on law, for less than five hundred dollars.”
I then offered him Baxter’s Call. Said he,
“That is too big a dose for me too.” I then
presented him the tract, “The Great Alternative.”
“Well,” said he, “as you are so anxious
for me to read some of your books, I
will read that right off.” He commenced,
and I left him. An hour or two after I was
passing his door, and he was sitting in a
thoughtful mood. Said I, “Have you read
the tract?” “Yes,” said he, “and if I would
read a few more like it I think I might become
a Christian.” Said I, “Too busy to be
saved.” “Yes,” said he, “I fear that is my
case; I have not a moment to spare from my
business.” Alas, how many will have to say,
I was too busy to be saved.</p>

<p>In the same town there was a man who had
once been a minister of some prominence in
an evangelical church, but had left it, and
embraced the doctrines of Swedenborg, for
which he was very zealous. I did not wish
to encounter him; but as I stepped into a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
store one night to scatter tracts, he was present.
He immediately made an attack on me,
and said that he could not imagine how any
wise man could believe in the doctrine of the
Trinity; that it was so absurd that nothing in
heaven or earth could illustrate it. I saw the
eyes of all present were turned to me, and felt
in a tight place. I lifted my heart to God for
help to vindicate his truth. A candle was
burning between us. Said I, pointing to the
candle, “Sir, there is a trinity giving us light.
There is tallow, wick, and fire, three in one.”
He acknowledged he was beat, and took his
leave, to the amusement of those present, and
to my great satisfaction.</p>

<p>After two months’ labor in South-western
Virginia, I returned to my home in L&mdash;&mdash;,
near two hundred miles distant from A&mdash;&mdash;,
and devoted a month to correspondence and
adjusting accounts with over fifty colporteurs
I had now employed.</p>

<p>Though L&mdash;&mdash; had been my home for over
two years, I had never had time to visit all
the families with our books and tracts. I had
often determined to do it, but other labors
had prevented. The number of warm friends
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
and liberal contributors in and around the
town seemed to lay special claims on me to
do the work, and I resolved to spend the
months of January and February laboring in
the town and vicinity.</p>

<p>At this time it was remarked by the ministers
and praying people of God, that they had
not felt such a spiritual dearth there for many
years. The ball-room was better attended
than the churches, and the young seemed to
be rushing into sin with greediness. My own
soul too was in darkness, and my strength
nearly prostrated. My devotions, public and
private, were heartless. I was even tempted
to leave my work and engage in some secular
business.</p>

<p>At last I told a few of the most pious whom
I knew about the desire I had to visit the
families, and that the state of my own heart
was such that I was prevented from doing
it. They urged me forward, and promised
to pray for me. I set day after day to begin;
but when the day and hour came for
me to start, my heart would fail, and Satan
seemed to have some excuse always ready.
At last I entered into covenant with God to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
begin the next day; but when the morning
came my hard, cowardly heart failed me. I
tried to pray again and again. I put it off
till the afternoon, with a hope of getting
strength. A carpet-bag had been standing
full of books and tracts for some days waiting,
and they seemed to rebuke my cowardice.</p>

<p>At last I thought that if Moses had not
stepped into the Red sea, the waters would
never have receded. The next morning still
found me at home. As soon as my breakfast
was over I took the carpet-bag and books to
a room and earnestly prayed over them, and
then started.</p>

<p>The next neighbor to me was a Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;.
His wife and mother-in-law were devoted
Christians, but he was careless about religion,
and so was his brother, a young man
that had his home there. I dealt faithfully
with them, and prayed with them. Each of
them bought a book, and I left them in tears.
Soon after the young man professed religion,
and the other remained serious as long as I
knew him. All my fears were now gone. A
few minutes before I was ashamed to own
Christ before a kitchen-maid; now I could
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
face the world, and the promise was realized,
“My strength is made perfect in weakness.”</p>

<p>I next went to Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;’s and had a long
talk with his daughter, a very intelligent girl
of twelve summers. In a short time she professed
religion.</p>

<p>I next entered the house of Mr. R&mdash;&mdash;.
He and his wife were two of the friends to
whom I had told my difficulties, and who had
engaged to pray for me. They had two very
interesting daughters that moved in the most
fashionable circles of society. As soon as I
entered the house they knew my errand. I
was directed to the parlor, and told by the
father, “I will send the girls in, and wife and
I will go into our own room and pray while
you talk.” I felt God was there while I talked
and prayed. One received Pike’s Persuasives
to Early Piety, the reading of which
led her to the Saviour soon after; the other
got Baxter’s Call, and was an inquirer during
all the time I remained there.</p>

<p>I cannot find words to express the joy I
felt in my own soul at the close of this day’s
work. All nature seemed to rejoice with me,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
and I fully realized the promise, “He that
watereth shall be watered.”</p>

<p>The next day I visited eleven families,
talked and prayed and sold and gave books
and tracts in every house. In almost every
house some feeling was manifested, and soon
after several professed religion. Among them
was a Mrs. M&mdash;&mdash;, who told me it was the
Anxious Inquirer that led her to Christ. I
visited half the town in a week, and sold and
gave away many books and tracts. Quite a
number of those visited showed much feeling
while I talked with them.</p>

<p>At this time special religious services were
held in one of the churches that had but little
sympathy at that time with the Tract Society,
or any thing else that was not under their
own exclusive control; and I was advised to
stop my work till their meeting closed, for
fear they might say I was proselyting. I attended
all their meetings, and prayed and
exhorted when called on. Their meetings
continued two weeks, during which time
twenty professed religion, most of whom I
had previously visited.</p>

<p>At the close of these meetings, I told the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Rev. Dr. McE&mdash;&mdash; that now was the time for
him to have meetings in his church. He said
he was not able to do any extra work, and
did not know where he could get any preacher.
I proposed to get the Rev. R. N. D&mdash;&mdash;,
who was then laboring as a colporteur of the
Tract Society some fifty miles distant, to
which he agreed, and I wrote to Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;
to come on a certain day. During the intervening
time of ten days I visited all the balance
of the town and held prayer-meetings
every night. The meetings became more and
more interesting, and religion became the
theme of conversation in every circle.</p>

<p>When Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; came public preaching
was held every night, and the word was attended
with the power of God. Every morning
we had a prayer-meeting, and through
the day visited the inquirers from house to
house, and scattered tracts. By the end of
four days thirty-five were attending the meeting
for inquiry, and at the close of the first
week thirty-three had professed hope in
Christ, most of them the most influential
people in the town.</p>

<p>The Rev. Mr. V&mdash;&mdash; then came and aided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
another week, at the close of which forty-two
were added to the church. Thus did God
carry on his work with the humble instruments
he had chosen.</p>

<p>One young lady who had been an inquirer
for two weeks, told us at last she did not care
about being converted then, and left the
meetings. In three weeks she died. Her
last words were, “I could have been saved,
but I rejected God’s Spirit, and now I am
lost.”</p>

<p>Another came sometimes to the inquiry
meetings, but owing to the fact that she was
soon to marry an irreligious man, put off her
day of grace. In a few weeks the day of her
intended marriage came. She rose in the
morning in usual health to prepare for the
ceremony, but before night her costly bridal
dress was her winding-sheet.</p>

<p>Four miles from town Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, a colporteur,
was at work during the time of this
meeting in the town, and ten were there
added to a little church.</p>

<p>I have been thus particular in stating the
facts in relation to this work, as it was the
starting point of one of the most powerful
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
revivals that I have ever witnessed. It extended
over one hundred miles square of a
sparsely populated country, in which near
one thousand souls were converted to God
within about four months. The fidelity and
perseverance in the service of Christ of those
thus brought in, is the best evidence that this
was truly the work of God’s Spirit.</p>

<p>At the close of these cheering labors in L&mdash;&mdash;,
I went to the town of U&mdash;&mdash; to be with Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; at a sacramental meeting, and take a
collection for the Tract Society. He is one
of God’s ministers that does his work faithfully.
The meeting began on Friday night.
Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; requested me to occupy the time
in giving an account of the great work at
L&mdash;&mdash;, which I did. Although but few were
present, and they mostly pupils in the academy
he taught, the bare relation of the facts
of the revival at L&mdash;&mdash; made a deep impression,
and resulted in the conversion of his
son, who is now a minister.</p>

<p>The next morning at nine, we had a meeting
for prayer and exhortation, at which there
was still more interest. At eleven Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;
preached. At night I conducted the service
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
by exhortation and prayer. The solemnity
was still increased. At each meeting we gave
each one present a suitable tract, with a word
of earnest counsel.</p>

<p>At nine, Sabbath morning, I conducted another
prayer-meeting. At eleven, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;
preached and administered the communion.
God was truly there in great power. At
three we had a meeting for prayer again. At
night the church was full. I based my remarks
on the words, “I will arise and go
to my father.” I saw that every heart was
moved, and but few cheeks were dry. At the
close of my remarks, I turned to Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;,
and said to him, “If you will ask them, some
anxious souls will remain for instruction and
prayer.” The result was, seven inquirers took
a stand on the Lord’s side that night. This
seemed to rouse the great soul of Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; to
an extraordinary pitch of fervor, and led to the
appointment of a meeting the next morning.</p>

<p>On Monday morning we both exhorted, and
the interest was deep. At three we held an
inquiry-meeting, and nine attended. At night
I spoke again; the meeting was deeply interesting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>Tuesday morning the prayer-meeting was
crowded, and in the afternoon there were
seventeen inquirers. We had three services
each day, the one at three only for inquirers;
and each day there was an increase of
interest. On Saturday morning Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;
had to go some miles to another preaching-place,
and I was left alone on Saturday and
the Sabbath. Sabbath, at three, there were
twenty-seven inquirers, and ten were indulging
a hope in Christ. During the next week
forty-two professed faith in Christ.</p>

<p>In the whole course of these meetings we
kept the very choicest of our books and tracts
in the hands of the people. One observing
Christian said to me, “There has been more
reading here on the subject of religion in the
past eighteen days, than there had been in
three years before.” Quite a number of the
inquirers told me they were first awakened
by reading a book or tract, and others that
they were greatly aided by them in coming
to Christ. Their interest in these publications
was shown by their contributing one
hundred dollars on one of the Sabbaths to
aid the tract and colporteur work.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>This town was one of the wickedest in
Western Virginia, and had for years been a
centre of infidelity. A worthy farmer who
lived near told me, at the close of our meetings,
that for years he had never passed
through that town without hearing oaths and
vulgar songs; “but now,” said he, “that is
all stopped, and I hear them singing hymns
of praise to God.” This town will now compare
favorably with any other within my
knowledge for piety and sobriety.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVI">CHAPTER XVI.</h2>

<p>At the earnest request of Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, I
promised to meet him on the next Sabbath
at one of his country churches, about six
miles from town, in one of the most densely
populated and wealthy communities in all
Western Virginia, called Mount P&mdash;&mdash;. It was
only fourteen miles from my home at L&mdash;&mdash;.
I reached the church a little before the hour
of service, a stranger to all except a few who
had met me at the meetings in town. The
house, although large, was crowded, and I
took a seat in the back part of the house. In
a few minutes Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; came in and walked
up into the pulpit. He looked sick and feeble,
and while glancing his eye over the house,
saw me, and beckoned me to him. He was
unable to speak louder than a whisper.</p>

<p>Said he, “I am attacked with bronchitis
and unable to preach, and you must preach.”
This I refused, on the ground that I had no
authority. Said he, “I will give you the
authority here, and stand between you and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
danger.” He arose, and with great exertion
told the people that he had never had such a
desire to preach as he had that day, but the
Lord had shut his mouth, and sent me to do
the preaching, for which he was very thankful.</p>

<p>I at once opened with singing and prayer,
and announced my text, “Behold, I stand at
the door and knock.” I felt that the thoughts
and words were not mine, but dictated by
the Holy Ghost. I spoke for an hour. The
audience was still as the grave. After an interval
of thirty minutes, as was the custom,
we resumed the service. My text in the afternoon
was, “Remember now thy Creator in
the days of thy youth.” The feeling was
deep. I asked the anxious to remain for instruction,
and twelve remained. At night I
had a meeting at a private house, where great
interest was manifested.</p>

<p>At the earnest request of many, services
similar to those of the Sabbath were continued
on Monday and for several days afterwards.
On Monday morning, when I came
to the church, there was a crowd, and much
to my joy and relief, Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, one of our
best colporteurs, was there. He had labored
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
faithfully over all that ground but a few
weeks before, and knew almost every one
in that region. Although very diffident, he
conducted the morning meeting with great
acceptance. I spoke at eleven, and at two;
and at the close of the last service we had
eighteen inquirers. God seemed to come
down as on the day of Pentecost. Ten of the
number indulged hope, and their countenances
were lit up with joy.</p>

<p>At night we had a meeting at Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;’s.
One half could not get into the house. He
had a son that was desperately wicked, and
had done all in his power to oppose the work
of God. During the time of the service he
went out of the house in an agony of conviction
for sin. The next morning, at family
prayers, he cried out in the bitterness of his
anguish, “God be merciful to me a sinner.”
A sister of his, that had been a very thoughtless
girl, also cried out in great distress.
This seemed instantly to electrify the whole
family. The place seemed awful with the
majesty of God. I felt as much of the divine
glory as I could bear. Such a scene I had
never witnessed. Soon the whole family
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
were embraced in each other’s arms, rejoicing
in hope of eternal life. We seemed to be in
the inner sanctuary and the most holy place.
Although near fourteen years have since
passed, while I describe this scene it fires my
own soul afresh.</p>

<p>Though it was a hurried season of the year
with farmers, work was suspended, ploughs
were stopped, white and black were in the
church, or as near in as they could get, as
the church would not hold more than half that
came.</p>

<p>The Tuesday morning prayer-meeting was
one of the best I ever attended. At eleven
the Rev. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; returned, and preached
one of the best of sermons. In the afternoon
I spoke again. There were thirty-six more
inquirers, and twelve more were indulging
hope.</p>

<p>On Friday night I held a meeting at the
house of a Dr. N&mdash;&mdash;, who was a man of the
world. I spoke on the <i>broad road and wide
gate</i>. The doctor was awakened that night,
and has ever since dated his first impressions
on religious subjects to that time; and two
young men, one of them since educated for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
the ministry, likewise dated their conversion
the same night.</p>

<p>At eleven the next morning Rev. Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; preached, and in the afternoon Dr.
McE&mdash;&mdash;. At the close of this service, sixty-two
were added to the church on profession
of their faith.</p>

<p>When the hour for public worship arrived
on Sabbath morning, one half could not enter
the church. It was arranged that I should
invite those who could not get in to assemble
out of hearing of the church and preach to
them. I selected the graveyard, where most
of the graves had enclosures of rails around
and over them. The circumstance suggested
my text: “Man dieth, and wasteth away; yea,
man giveth up the ghost, and where is he?”
I felt as I never did before, standing among
the dead and the living, and spoke as I never
did before or since. Some of the wickedest
men in all the country were before me.</p>

<p>One gray-headed sinner seventy years old,
who sat on the rails which were around the
graves of his wife and children, shook as if
he had the ague. A year after, he died; and
often, when he was on his death-bed, spoke
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
with deep sorrow of resisting God’s Spirit at
that time. At the close of the services in the
church a collection of $120 was taken up for
the Tract Society, which was five times as
much as could have been obtained a week
before. Books and tracts were circulated
every day in these meetings, and read with
interest. Twenty persons told me that books
or tracts were the means of either awakening
them, or directing them to Christ. In
addition to the sixty-two added to the church
as above, twenty-four who obtained a hope
at these meetings joined a church of another
denomination a mile distant.</p>

<p>Only two miles from the above meetings,
was the church of a large congregation of
Seceders. Till this time they had not gone
to hear any preacher but their own, nor admitted
any other denomination to preach in
their church. But so great was this work
that some of their young people had been
drawn away, and gained a hope in Christ,
but kept it secret. Their pastor, Rev. Mr.
McG&mdash;&mdash;, came himself on Saturday, and became
deeply moved with what he saw and
heard. In the evening Rev. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; told
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
him there were many still anxious about their
souls, and not a few of them were among his
own people; “and now,” said he, “this harvest
must be gathered, and if you will go on
with a meeting next week I will close my
meetings to-morrow.” This arrangement was
made, and it was agreed that I should go and
assist Mr. McG&mdash;&mdash; on the afternoon of the
next day, after the services in that church
should be closed.</p>

<p>At four o’clock the Seceder church was
crowded, and all the ardor of feeling seemed
to come along with the people. Rev. Mr.
McG&mdash;&mdash; was very feeble in health, but was
a devoted servant of God; and it was arranged
that he was to take a text and speak
ten minutes, and I was then to fill up the
hour. After that service we held another in
a private house at night.</p>

<p>The next morning at nine, we had the house
full at the prayer-meeting. At eleven, Mr.
McG&mdash;&mdash; preached ten minutes, and I followed;
and after the service all were supplied
with tracts. During the afternoon service
the presence of God seemed to move every
heart. And as I believe that when God
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
moves on men’s hearts, they ought to move
too as the prodigal did, when I had ceased
speaking, and the congregation were singing
the eighty-fourth Psalm, Rouse’s version, I
said to Mr. McG&mdash;&mdash; that I had no doubt
but if an invitation was given some would remain
for instruction. He feared it would not
be acceptable to the officers of the church,
all of whom had come from Scotland, and
had been accustomed to hear preaching only
from Seceders, and considered <i>occasional hearing</i>
an offence. But he said he would not interfere
with what I thought was duty.</p>

<p>As soon as the song was sung, I arose and
told them that a piece of old Scotch history
had just come into my mind. That over one
hundred years ago, previous to their communion
occasions, the minister at the close
of his services for some days would invite all
that intended to commune for the first time
to remain for instruction in regard to their
duties; and that for want of that many came
to the Lord’s table who were ignorant of the
nature of the ordinance. And as I believed
there were a number who contemplated joining
the church and going to the communion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
table on the next Sabbath for the first time,
I would ask all such to remain after the congregation
was dismissed, to receive such instruction
as should be given. After some
agitation all was quiet, and I told them the
first point of inquiry for them was, to know if
they were born again, and spoke some twenty
minutes on the nature and evidences of regeneration.
The old elders sobbed aloud;
and as soon as the services were closed, they
had me by the hand, and said, “That is just
what our young people need.” The oldest elder,
whose daughter was among the inquirers,
came up leaning on his staff, and said, “That
did my soul good.” We had an appointment
that night five miles distant, and this old man
went all the way with me on horseback. The
house was crowded. Many were awakened,
and among them Mr. B&mdash;&mdash; the proprietor,
who was a hardened sinner of fifty years.
He soon professed his faith in Christ.</p>

<p>The next morning this old elder, Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;,
said to me, “Oh, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, I slept none last
night. I have had a foretaste of heaven, and
long to be there. I have never experienced
religious joy till last night; and now I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
one request to make, and deny me not, that
is, that you commune with me next Sabbath.”</p>

<p>The next day we had similar services, and
at the close of the last service I told them as
all the congregation seemed desirous to hear
what was said to those wishing to consider
their duty to join the church, such would
come forward while we sung the twenty-third
Psalm. Sixteen thus presented themselves,
and Rev. Mr. McG&mdash;&mdash; spoke to them
with a heavenly unction. The next day there
were twenty-eight inquirers, and the next day
thirty-nine, of whom twenty-two appeared to
be indulging a good hope in Christ. All the
business of the field was suspended, and many
were saying it was the dawn of the day of
glory to the church. As the time had arrived
for me to visit another place fifty miles
distant, to engage in similar labors, the pastor
told them he wanted them to make a
thank-offering to the Tract Society, and in a
few minutes $80 was on the table, and a present
of $20 to me. On the Sabbath fifty-six
were added to the church, and more than
thirty to a Methodist church near by.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span></p>

<p>Fourteen months after, I visited this church
again. The presence of God was still there,
and many said they felt as if they were ready
to begin again where they had left off fourteen
months before. The strong prejudices
against worshipping with other Christians
were among the things that had been.</p>

<p>During my brief stay many incidents were
related to me. One young man told me it was
“Advice to a Married Couple” that awakened
him, as he was soon to be married. Three
of the anxious got relief by reading the tract
“What is it to Believe in Christ?” A man
well acquainted in the community told me
thirty family altars were reared on one Sabbath
night.</p>

<p>In one instance two families lived in one
house, and both the men and their wives had
joined the church. They felt that they must
have family worship, but neither was willing
to pray. One said he could do the singing,
and the other said he would read the Bible.
At last they united in asking a lame negro
man that was pious, and he led in prayer.</p>

<p>There is probably no region of our country,
when all the difficulties are considered,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
where the Tract Society and colporteurs
have done as much real good as in Western
Virginia. Some of the most godly men we
ever employed had visited every house again
and again, and most of the books to be found
in the houses were the Society’s publications.
In some of the poorer districts they were
even the only school-books. I have heard of
schools in those mountains where one had
Bunyan, another Baxter’s Call, or Saints’
Rest, and so on all through the school. We
can say that in many places the work has
made the wilderness and the solitary place
rejoice and blossom as the rose.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</h2>

<p>After one night’s rest at home, I left the
next morning for C&mdash;&mdash;, thirty miles distant,
to meet my friend Rev. Mr. D&mdash;&mdash;, who was
with us at the commencement of the meetings
at L&mdash;&mdash;, and engage in another meeting.
The Rev. Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, who was pastor at
that place, was likewise a colporteur of the
Tract Society, and had five little churches in
as many different communities in the county.
So he left us to hold a meeting in C&mdash;&mdash;,
while he was laboring in other portions of
his field.</p>

<p>I had on several occasions passed through
this town, which, in a religious view, was one
of the darkest I have ever visited. I saw the
men, most of them young men, while Mr.
P&mdash;&mdash; was preaching to a few, mostly women,
standing all round the church with their heads
in the windows, talking aloud, and even swearing
profanely, till the preacher’s voice could
scarcely be heard. As Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; was a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
stranger there, I informed him that we might
expect open opposition. The meetings were
to be conducted in the same way as those to
which I have already alluded.</p>

<p>After warning the people of the impropriety
of such conduct, and insisting that if they
attended the services, they should come into
the church, Mr. D&mdash;&mdash; preached, and I followed
by telling of the Lord’s work in the
places where I had been. A deep solemnity
seemed to fall on every soul, and we felt God
was there. All present were well supplied
with tracts.</p>

<p>The next day our meetings were very solemn,
and still more so at night, when there
were five anxiously inquiring for salvation.
By the next night most of the females began
to feel very deeply, and some young men
began to interrupt by their talking; but I
rebuked them most solemnly, and we had no
more interruptions during that meeting, and
I am happy to say there have been none since
in that place.</p>

<p>This meeting began on Thursday night,
and by Monday twenty-two had professed
hope in Christ. Among the number was one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
man sixty years old. He had been intemperate
forty years. Though he was then so
ignorant that he did not know who was the
Saviour of sinners, and did not know one
letter of the alphabet, he still lives a monument
of grace.</p>

<p>One young lady of fortune, who was there
at school, and whose anxiety about her soul
bordered on despair, gained a hope on Saturday.
On the next Saturday she joined the
church, and then told her companions, “I
will go to the Lord’s table to-morrow; it may
be my last Sabbath on earth.” On Monday
morning she came to school apparently in her
usual health, and seemed deeply affected by
the opening prayer; but soon complained of
being unwell, went to her boarding-house,
and in forty-eight hours she was numbered
with the dead. Grace and glory came very
near together.</p>

<p>After a few days of rest, at the request of
the Rev. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash;, to whom I have alluded
at the town of U&mdash;&mdash;, I met him in an old
log-church on Wolf Creek, one of his preaching-places.
I left home in the morning, rode
twenty-four miles, and reached the place at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
one. Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; was preaching to a small
congregation, as it was now the beginning
of harvest. After an interval of thirty minutes,
I addressed the people. The next day
was Saturday. The house was full; and in
the evening we had five inquirers. Sabbath
morning Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; preached with great power,
and then left for another appointment,
with the expectation of returning on Monday.
In the mean time I was to go on with the
services. In the evening I had thirteen inquirers;
and among them was Colonel H&mdash;&mdash;,
fifty years old, and Major B&mdash;&mdash;, sixty-eight,
two men of the largest wealth and highest
standing in that community, who had been
remarkable instances of grieving the Spirit
of God. I related in their hearing the fact
of what an aged man had told me about his
grieving the Spirit. I saw it affected them
both very deeply. They told me they had
felt all that that man did whose case I had described,
and that they had now made up their
minds to seek Christ. In a few days both
were hoping in Christ; and two years ago
they had continued active Christians.</p>

<p>Becoming exhausted, almost as if I was at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
death’s door, I left for home; but Rev. Mr.
H&mdash;&mdash; continued the meetings. Such was
the interest awakened, that daily labor in the
harvest-field was entirely suspended. Masters
and servants were all at the same mercy-seat.
God was there; the world was lost
sight of, and eternal things took its place.
Everybody had a tract in hand. You could
see them reading on their way home; some
in carriages, some on horseback, and others
on foot. The result was, thirty-six were added
to that little church, and many others to
the other churches in that region of country. I
soon learned that one wild, thoughtless young
woman was awakened by reading a tract, and
she is now one of the mothers in Israel.</p>

<p>I had received several letters from the Rev.
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, an aged man who had moved to
Fayette county, to preach in a very destitute
region, near the celebrated <i>Hawk’s Nest</i>, or
<i>Marshall’s Pillar</i>, a cliff or precipice of about
one thousand feet perpendicular height, hanging
over New River, ten miles from its junction
with the Gauley. After a day of rest, I
took the stage, and at the end of fifty miles
reached the place. On Friday morning the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
meeting began in the woods. No church was
near; but an arbor was made by putting up
poles and covering them with green bushes.
When I came it rained, and only about thirty
were present; but God was there with his
gracious power. We had a meeting in the
evening at one of the neighboring cabins,
and a crowd was collected.</p>

<p>The next morning we met at the arbor.
The day was fair and beautiful, and the crowd
great. The Lord helped me greatly in the
service. At the interval I scattered tracts
freely, and set all to reading who could read.
At the close of the afternoon service there
were eleven anxious inquirers. On Sabbath
morning we met at nine for prayer. By
eleven o’clock a thousand people had assembled;
and after the evening service, seventeen
came out for instruction. On Monday the
communion was to be administered, and seventeen
were added to the Lord’s people. The
Lord was there in his mercy. After the afternoon
service nineteen more came out as
inquirers, among them men of sixty years
and from that down to boys, most of whom
professed religion soon after. A church was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
soon after organized, which still lives. The
blessed influence spread for miles around,
and all denominations shared in the glorious
work. I shall ever believe the way was prepared
by a faithful colporteur, who had been
over the ground a few months before.</p>

<p>Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;, an elder in a vacant church
called Locust Bottom, had applied to the
Rev. Mr. P&mdash;&mdash; to come and administer the
communion in that church, and to bring me
with him. The meeting was to begin on the
Friday before the third Sabbath in August.
I left home on Thursday morning, and reached
the place, fifty-four miles distant, at noon
the next day. In the afternoon I addressed
the audience by telling them what the Lord
had done in so many other places, and that
I felt assured if they would seek him with
their whole hearts he would bless them too.</p>

<p>The next morning we were assembled at
nine for prayer and exhortation. At eleven
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, a student of divinity, spoke with
much fervor. After recess I spoke with much
liberty, and five came out as inquirers. We
held meetings at night in two places; both
well attended, and several were awakened.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
The Sabbath morning prayer-meeting was
crowded. The communion was administered
by Mr. P&mdash;&mdash;; and after recess I spoke again,
and we had nine inquirers. The next morning
we had a crowd, and there were clear indications
of the presence of the Spirit of God.</p>

<p>Some weeks previous, Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, a colporteur
to whom I have alluded, had been all
through this region, and circulated books.
A daughter of Colonel S&mdash;&mdash;, one of the elders,
became awakened by reading one of them, and
her state of mind had aroused some of her
friends and companions, who were among
those most deeply concerned; and it was
agreed to hold the evening meeting at the
colonel’s, though four miles distant.</p>

<p>In addition to the colonel’s large family, a
number of others were present, all seeking
peace with God. After tea was over we were
all seated in a large parlor, to the number
of at least twenty. As Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; expected
soon to leave, I asked him to lead us in prayer,
and especially to remember the anxious souls
in the room. At the close of the prayer, one
of the colonel’s daughters was sobbing as if
she would break her heart. I sat down beside
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
her, and pointed her to Jesus who died
for sinners. She looked at me a moment, and
then sprang into her mother’s arms, and said,
“Oh, mother, I have found Jesus.” But a
short time had elapsed, when a daughter-in-law
of Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash; went to her and said, “Oh,
mother, I have found the Saviour too.” Soon
the wife of one of the elders who was there
cried, “Oh, Mrs. S&mdash;&mdash;, the Saviour has
blessed me too. Oh, what a Saviour I have
found.” This woman had been so opposed
to religion that her husband could not have
family prayers. All these three had been
awakened by reading tracts. During all this
time the old grandmother, ninety years old,
and for over seventy years a follower of Christ,
was walking through the house saying, “Oh,
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;, is not this heaven? my poor soul
can bear no more of the divine glory.”</p>

<p>In a short time Colonel S&mdash;&mdash;, who had
been absent, returned. As soon as his daughter
saw him she was in his arms, saying, “Oh,
my dear father, your prayers are answered;
I have found Jesus.”</p>

<p>By this time the news had spread all over
the farm, and more than fifty blacks of all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
ages were in and round the house. The old
mother of Col. S&mdash;&mdash; said to me, “Oh, Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash;, won’t you preach to these poor souls?”
“Certainly,” said I; and in a few minutes a
large room was crowded with them. I stood
in the door, with the old mother holding me
by the arm, and announced the words, “Behold,
I bring you glad tidings of great joy
which shall be to all people.” The negroes
soon became so excited they could hardly contain
themselves. Some were on their knees
praying, and others clapping their hands.
The old lady undertook to keep them in order;
but her own heart became so deeply impressed,
that her bodily strength sunk under
it. The scene was one that neither tongue
nor pen can describe. No doubt some who
have never seen or felt any thing like this,
will call it enthusiasm; but if it was, I would
wish to live and die in the midst of such enthusiasm.
This was one of the most intelligent
families in that community&mdash;all educated
and refined, and strict Presbyterians.
I have found but few such families.</p>

<p>The next morning we all repaired to the
church, where I was met by Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
colporteur whom I have mentioned. Before
that day’s meeting closed eight more professed
hope. That night I had a meeting at
a Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;’s, who was a professed atheist,
but within a few days after, was numbered
among God’s people.</p>

<p>The next day the house was crowded below
with whites, and the gallery with blacks.
The presence of God seemed to be with every
soul. There were in the house two men,
brothers, of large wealth and much intelligence,
both unmarried and somewhat dissipated.
For two days they had been deeply
concerned, and their pious friends were earnest
in prayer for them. Just as I was closing
my last discourse in the evening, when
there was scarce a dry cheek in the house, a
negro who was subject to fits, fell in a fit in
the gallery, and made the most unearthly
noise I ever heard. All fled from the house
with fright, thinking the house was falling.
These two brothers, when they went out, said
they were glad at what had happened, for if
they had remained any longer they would have
been compelled to yield to the Spirit of God.
They both went away, and never returned;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
and said often afterwards that they sealed
their damnation that day. Each of them died
a horrible death with delirium tremens.</p>

<p>I exhorted three or four times each day
throughout all the week, and brother W&mdash;&mdash;
scattered books and tracts, and talked and
prayed. Twenty-two were added to that
church, and as many more joined other
churches. Before this meeting began, that
church was nearly broken up, and in six
months after, the student to whom I have
alluded was the pastor.</p>

<p>Ten years after, as I was passing through
this region in a stage, one of my travelling
companions told me he was one of the converts
at a place where I had labored. We
were alone in the stage when we reached the
place of crossing a river near this church.
The driver stopped to water his horses, and
I handed tracts to two men that were working
at the edge of the river. They looked at
me a moment, and then caught my hands:
“Oh, this is Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;. It was your tracts
and labors that God blessed to save our
souls.” The stage-driver dropped his bucket
and rushed to me: “Oh, is it possible I have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
been hauling Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; and did not know it?
It was your tracts and labors which you began
in the rain in Fayette county that God
blessed to my soul.” Here were four men
who had been led to Christ at different places,
and now had met the one whom they called
the instrument of their salvation. To God
alone be all the glory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XVIII">CHAPTER XVIII.</h2>

<p>As, in the providence of God, I have been
brought into contact with thousands of persons
who have told me with much candor
the history of their own minds, and conversed
freely in reference to the all-important
subject of their salvation, I have thought it to
be my duty to record some of the facts I have
met, for the benefit and warning of others.
That there is a point when the Holy Spirit,
if wilfully and perseveringly resisted, ceases
to strive with man, no one doubts who believes
in his renewing and sanctifying agency;
but too many take it for granted that this
point is not reached till the close of life, and
neglect or resist the strivings of the Spirit
till he gives them up to hardness of heart
and blindness of mind, perhaps many years
before their earthly existence has terminated.</p>

<p>The first case I shall mention is that of a
woman about thirty years of age, with whom
I conversed in the presence of her mother. I
inquired if she was a member of any church.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
She answered, “No.” I asked if she had not
at some time felt concern for her salvation.
“Yes,” she said, “I think but few have been
more anxious on the subject than I was once.”
I asked at what period of her life this occurred,
when she gave me the following account
of God’s dealings with her. “When I
was about fifteen years old, I felt that I was
a great sinner in the sight of God. Often
my distress was so great that I could not
sleep; and for three years I seldom had
peace for a week at a time. I knew that the
Holy Spirit was striving with me, and that I
ought to yield my heart to his influence; but
I thought it would cut off my pleasures in
the midst of youth. I tried to banish the
thoughts of eternity; but they would still
return and interrupt my pleasure. I tried
reading novels and romances; they gave me
relief for a while, but my distress returned.
At last I went to the ballroom&mdash;and I have
never since had such feelings as before.”
“And have you no fears,” said I, “that you
have grieved away the Spirit of God for
ever?” “Yes,” she replied, “I have no doubt
of that, and that I shall be lost.” I proceeded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
to describe the state and misery of the
lost, and appealed to her, by the prayers of
her mother and the tears which were then
falling from her sunken eyes, by the danger
of an eternal separation from pious friends,
by the glories of heaven and the agonies of
the Son of God, now to make her peace with
him and be saved. “All this,” she calmly
replied, “has been tried upon me before.
Nothing that you or any other man can say
on that subject, can move me now. My doom
is fixed.”</p>

<p>Another case was that of Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;, who
was over seventy years old, and living an ungodly
life. I approached him with kindness,
and at length he conversed freely. I spoke
of the goodness of God to him in his advanced
years, and asked if he hoped he had
an interest in Christ. He replied, “No.” I
asked if he received the Bible as the word of
God. He answered, “Yes.” I said, “The
Bible teaches that a man must be born again
before he can enter the kingdom of God; do
you think you have experienced that change?”
“No,” said he, “I never have.” I saw that
he was intelligent, and inquired if no “still
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
small voice” had ever whispered to him,
“Son, give me thy heart?” “Yes,” said he,
“often. I used to feel, but for many years I
have not felt as I did when I was young. I
then had some very serious times.” I asked
at what period he had felt most deeply the
importance of religion. He replied, “When
I was seventeen I began to feel deeply at
times, and this continued for two or three
years; but I determined to put it off till I
should be settled in life. After I was married,
I reflected that the time had come when
I had promised to attend to religion; but I
had bought this farm, and I thought it would
not suit me to become religious till it was
paid for, as some time would have to be devoted
to attend church, and also some expense.
I then resolved to put it off ten years;
but when the ten years came round, I thought
no more about it. I often try to think, but I
cannot keep my mind on the subject one
moment.” I urged him by all the terrors of
dying an enemy of God, to set about the work
of repentance. “It is too late,” said he, “I
believe my doom is sealed; and it is just that
it should be so, for the Spirit strove long with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
me, but I refused.” I then turned to his children,
young men and young women who were
around him, and entreated them not to put
off the subject of religion, or grieve the Spirit
of God in their youthful days. The old man
added, “Mind <i>that</i>. If I had attended to it
then, it would have been well with me to-day;
but now it is too late.”</p>

<p>On conversing with a man in middle life,
he informed me that his father was a devoted
Christian, that he was faithfully instructed
and his mind was early impressed with the
importance of religion. In his youth, there
was a period of six months in which he was
in distress, day and night; and a voice within
seemed to be continually saying, “Forsake
your sins and come unto me, and I will give
you peace.” “But,” he added, “I did not
wish to be a Christian then; I thought it
would ruin my pleasures. I visited a part of
the country where dancing and balls were
frequent; in a little time my serious thoughts
were gone, and I have never had any since.”
I asked if he did not fear that God had given
him up. “Yes,” said he, “I am afraid he
has. I go to church and read the Bible, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
try to feel, but I cannot.” I strove to arouse
his fears, but it was in vain. I afterwards
learned that he was pursuing his worldly
business on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>It is not for me to pronounce that God had
said of all these persons, they are “joined to
their idols, let them alone;” “woe to them
when I depart from them;” but the state of
all such is unspeakably alarming. If the eye
of such a one falls upon these lines&mdash;if you
have persisted in saying, “Go thy way for
this time; let me alone, that I may have the
pleasures of this life,” and have quenched
the Spirit by resorting to amusements, the
novel, the ballroom, or the theatre, God may
have given you what you desired; but what
have you now of all these pleasures? Can
you look back upon them with an approving
conscience? Will they bring you consolation
in a dying hour? Have you not even
now in your own soul, if you would make the
confession, the gnawings of the worm that
never dies, the burning of the fire that is
never quenched? If the Spirit of God is now
striving with you, it is the most momentous
period of your existence. It is perhaps the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
turning-point between heaven and hell&mdash;the
songs of angels, or the wailings of the finally
lost. Beware of stifling the Spirit. Multitudes
have told me the dreadful tale, “I went
to scenes of amusement, or turned to the exciting
romance, and I have felt no anxiety
since.” While the Spirit strives it is the
seed-time of eternal life, the embryo of a
happy immortality. Sit not down to count
the loss of sinful pleasures; receive the Saviour
into your heart, and you will have pleasures
lasting as eternity&mdash;pleasures that leave
no sting behind&mdash;pleasures that will sustain
the soul when on your dying pillow, when the
last trumpet shall sound, and the congregated
world stand before God.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Many facts of a more cheering character
might be given. The Rev. N. C&mdash;&mdash;, who had
a pastoral charge in M&mdash;&mdash; county, said to
me, “A colporteur had left a copy of the
Anxious Inquirer in the house of a wealthy
man in M&mdash;&mdash; county. After some time he
became interested for his salvation. One day
while there on a visit I pointed him to a chapter
in this book, and requested him to read it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
He read it, and soon found peace. Like every
real Christian, he desired the salvation of his
relations. He sent the book to his brother, a
physician, who, together with a sister, were
led to Christ by reading it. The book is kept
in the family as an heir-loom.” On another
occasion Rev. Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; said he was sent
for to go some distance to see a sick woman.
His custom was always to carry with him a
few select books to give or loan. He gave
her a copy of the Anxious Inquirer, and requested
her husband to read it to her. Both
were irreligious; but by God’s blessing on
reading this book, both were led to the Saviour.
A colporteur sold a copy of the same
book to a man who sent it to an absent son.
It led him and two of his companions to
Christ. A colporteur gave a copy of Baxter’s
Call to a very wicked family, who never went
to church. Within ten months he found the
reading of it had been blessed to three of
the household. A tract put into a wagoner’s
feed-trough while driving his team
on the Sabbath, was the means of stopping
him from travelling on the Sabbath,
and led him to repentance. He became
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
eminent for his piety and usefulness in the
church.</p>

<p>A missionary who preached once a month
in a wild region, and gave part of his time
to colporteur work, often told me of a family
that lived just beside his little mountain
church, but never entered it. When he began
the colporteur work he made them a
visit. The man told him he did not wish
him to say any thing to him on the subject
of religion; that if he wanted to hear him,
he could go to the church. All the time he
talked and prayed, the man was muttering,
and his wife increased the speed of her wheel
to drown his voice. Finding all his efforts to
get their attention in vain, he laid down a
copy of Baxter’s Call and a few tracts, and
left them. On his return to fill his next appointment
at the little church, to his surprise
this man and his wife were in the church near
the pulpit. During service they were deeply
exercised. At the close he spoke to them
about their souls. They told him that after
he left their house they began to think about
the way they had treated him, and had read
his little books, and found they were great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
sinners. At his next communion they both
joined his church, and they were among the
most consistent and useful of its members.</p>

<p>One morning I took the stage to go to the
railroad, some sixteen miles distant. There
were two gentlemen in the stage. Both
knew me, but I did not know them. One
was a preacher, with whom I talked all the
way to the d&eacute;p&ocirc;t. While waiting for the cars,
the other passenger, a fine-looking young
man, said, “I can’t let this opportunity pass
without making myself known to you. Do
you remember laying your hand on the
shoulder of a youth in the town of B&mdash;&mdash;
six years ago, and urging him to seek the favor
of God, and handing him a little book?”
I said I had no recollection of it, as I was
doing something of that sort almost every
day. “Well,” said he, “that talk and book
were the means, I trust, of my salvation. I
have since that time gone through college,
and hope soon to preach the gospel.” He
was the son of a poor widow. He is now an
able minister of the New Testament.</p>

<p>One day while on a journey, I came to a
very small cabin on the top of a high mountain.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
A poor widow was by the door in very
homely apparel. I asked her if she had a
Bible. “No,” said she, “but I have a part
of a Testament, and a number of little tracts.”
Seeing a number of clean but poorly clad
children, I began to ask them questions.
The answers they gave would have done
credit to most of our Sunday-school children.
I asked her if she had a church or Sunday-school
near. “No; there is no church or
Sunday-school anywhere in reach. My children
have never been in either, and I have
not been at church for eight years.” “Why,”
said I, “madam, how have you got your children
so well instructed?” She ran into her
cabin and brought her whole library, which
consisted of a part of a Testament, and several
little books and tracts sewed together,
which I learned had been given her by colporteurs
in their visits. Said she, “I read
these to my children every Sunday, and teach
them to read them, till they know all that is
in them.” I added to her supply little books
till the countenances of herself and her children
were radiant with joy, and I felt it was
truly “more blessed to give than to receive.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span></p>

<p>A few miles further on I stopped at another
cabin. The woman looked at me a moment.
“Oh, I know you. You are the man that
preached and gave us tracts at the church
down on the river. I trust I was converted
there. Can’t you give me some tracts to
give away? I am living now among very
wicked people.” I gave her a package, and
passed on.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XIX">CHAPTER XIX.</h2>

<p>On the invitation of several leading men,
I visited L&mdash;&mdash;, east of the mountains. The
evening I got there the Rev. Mr. N&mdash;&mdash; called
on me to “hold forth the word of life” for
him that night. He stated that there was
some interest in his church, and that he was
unable to make any special effort, on account
of his health. Although I had travelled forty
miles that day by stage, in an hour I was addressing
the people; and for eight days meetings
were continued by exhorting and scattering
tracts; at the close of which time
twenty-two had professed faith in Christ,
some of them among the most influential men
in the city.</p>

<p>On the first Sabbath morning I was there,
a lady of earnest piety prevailed on her husband,
who was a Universalist and had been
raised in that faith, and a young German
whom he had employed as a clerk, to accompany
her to the church. This German had
been a tutor in one of the colleges in Germany,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
a man of fine education; but he was
connected with a rebellion against the government,
and had to fly in the night, and made
an almost miraculous escape in disguise. He
was an infidel. My subject was, “the worth
of the soul;” and God truly gave me what I
said. They both became awakened; and
seven years after, Mr. H&mdash;&mdash; the husband of
the lady joined the church, and is now an
elder. He says he was never without conviction
from that Sabbath morning till he
yielded to Christ.</p>

<p>The German, Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, became intensely
exercised. He attended all the inquiry meetings,
and often called on the pastor, Mr.
N&mdash;&mdash;. His agony of mind bordered on despair.
He was told again and again that
whenever he could give up all for Christ he
would find peace. After spending a whole
night in prayer, he came to Mr. N&mdash;&mdash; in the
morning, woke him out of sleep, and said,
“Mr. N&mdash;&mdash;, I have nothing on earth I care
for but this box of rings and jewels, which
my mother and sisters took from their ears
and fingers the night I fled from Germany;
these I have held as sacred mementos of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
their love. Take them, sell them, and give
to the poor.” Mr. N&mdash;&mdash; said, “Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;,
you are not far from the kingdom of God;
let us pray.” In a few moments he threw
his arms around Mr. N&mdash;&mdash;’s neck, saying,
“Oh, I have found Jesus.” Mr. N&mdash;&mdash; handed
him back the box, and said, “Mr. S&mdash;&mdash;, the
Lord does not need the jewels. All he required
was, that feeling of heart you manifested
in giving them up.” This man is now
a missionary in some of the islands of the sea.
His talents are all consecrated to God.</p>

<p>A young lady, Miss L&mdash;&mdash;, very wealthy
and proud, became awakened, and continued
for many days on the verge of despair. She
hardly ate or slept. She even became desperate:
said God was not as good as his
word; that she was willing to give up all for
Christ, but he would not save her. We talked
and prayed with her several times each day,
but all in vain. At last I said to her, “Miss
L&mdash;&mdash;, you say you are willing to give up
all for Christ?” “Yes,” said she, “even life
itself.” “Well,” said I, “in the name of my
Master I ask you, out of your large wealth,
to give me a donation for the Tract Society.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
She replied sternly, “I am not going to buy
my salvation.” Said I, “The Lord can do
without your money; but I have asked this
to show you the deceitfulness of your own
heart. You said a moment ago that you
would give even life itself. Now,” said I, “I
shall leave you to reflect.” In a few days she
sent for me to rejoice with her, and the donation
was heartily made.</p>

<p>I then labored for three weeks in other
churches in the city, and a large number
professed religion.</p>

<p>Among other services, I was a week with
Rev. Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, who has been for some
years president of one of our auxiliary tract
societies. At the close of his meeting one
day, he said he would tell them what one tract
had done. He gave the tract, “Have you the
Wedding Garment?” to a young lady, with
the request that she would go and read it
over three times. She did so, and the next
day she came to him as an inquirer. He
then gave it to her sister, making the same
request, and the next day she was an inquirer.
He then gave it to a young man, and he has
been led to Christ by it. “And here before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
you,” said he, “are all three of them now
rejoicing in hope.”</p>

<p>The last month of the year 1850, I was invited
by the Rev. Mr. C&mdash;&mdash; to visit M&mdash;&mdash;
county, and spend a week with him at each
of his charges, as he had two. The distance
was ninety miles; the roads almost impassable.
I shrunk from the journey; but a voice
seemed to say, “You must go.” When I
reached the town they were holding a temperance
convention, which I addressed on
two occasions.</p>

<p>On Sunday morning I spoke first on the
tract cause, and raised a collection of $150.
The night service was well attended. We
continued meeting twice each day, and visited
families and distributed books and tracts
all the rest of the time till Wednesday, but
with no very marked results.</p>

<p>Notice had been given that meetings would
begin at B&mdash;&mdash;, Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;’s other charge,
nine miles distant, on Thursday morning at
eleven. We reached there at the hour, and
had only eleven hearers. At the close of the
service we were invited to a Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;’s to
dine. He was a backslider, rich and eccentric.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
We had determined to visit families,
talk, pray, and circulate tracts, till the time
for the night service.</p>

<p>When we came to Mr. B&mdash;&mdash;’s, the old man
invited us into the parlor, and in a few minutes
one of his daughters came in, a very
beautiful girl, and highly educated. After a
little time I introduced the subject of religion
to her kindly and politely. She gave me one
of the most scornful looks I ever got, and rose
to leave me. I was holding in my hand the
tract “<i>Don’t be Offended</i>;” and just as she
was passing me I presented it before her. I
saw the father was offended too. Rev. Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash; and I both felt unhappy; but in a few
minutes we were called to dinner, and Mr.
C&mdash;&mdash; introduced me to two other daughters,
which made all the family.</p>

<p>When we were nearly through dinner, the
offended one came to the table. Her eyes
indicated that she had been weeping, but
nothing was said. After dinner we went to
another house, and met a young lady who
was teacher in the female academy and also
in a dancing-school. She made very light of
religion, and said she preferred the ballroom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
to the church. I spoke to her the truth very
plainly, and gave her a tract on dancing;
and she turned away offended, and said she
had no respect for such Puritanical religion.
At night we had a tolerably good congregation,
and the Lord was there indeed. Such
was the state of things, that we invited all
that were concerned about their souls to remain;
and to our utter astonishment, the
two offended ones were among them, weeping
bitterly. The exhibition they had made of
their wickedness had so overwhelmed them
that they could scarcely wait till night to
confess their sins.</p>

<p>The next morning we resumed our visits.
The first visit was to Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;’s, an elder in
the church. In conversation with a daughter
of his she manifested much feeling. I
gave a tract to one of his sons, who, after
reading it, came to his mother, and said,
“Oh, mother, if I was to die as I am, my
soul would be lost.” That day and night the
congregation was large. By this time the
pious people in the church had awoke, and
all were at work with books and tracts.
Business was almost suspended in the village,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
and religion was the only theme. Almost
all were inquiring the way to Zion, with
the exception of half a dozen men, who threw
every obstacle they could in the way. One
of the worst of them went away to get out of
the influence of the meetings, and was dead
in three days. Another left his business and
went to the country to avoid the presence of
God, and has since died without hope.</p>

<p>The interest had become intense. On the
way home from church three young ladies obtained
hope almost simultaneously, and were
all embraced in each other’s arms. A short
time after, a number of the anxious were assembled
at Mr. T&mdash;&mdash;’s, where I was stopping.
All were pleading for mercy, but soon they
began to sing praises to God. They were
heard by people around, and in a short time
many assembled. The new-born souls were
rushing into the arms of each other, and of
their fathers and mothers, and thanking them
for their prayers. This joy was no doubt much
like that of the day of Pentecost. One hundred
and twenty-five professed their faith in
Christ, and were soon after added to the
churches; and so far as I have been able to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
learn, there was no case of backsliding.
Where God does the work, the work is well
done; but where it is done by mere human
machinery, the results are very unsatisfactory.
The town was revolutionized by this
outpouring of the Spirit. The ballroom gave
way to the prayer-meeting, and the drunkard’s
songs to those of Zion.</p>

<p>I gave Baxter’s Call to a youth during this
meeting, who told me, eight years afterwards
when I met him a preacher, that that book
was the means of his salvation, and had it
not been for it, he never should have entered
the ministry.</p>

<p>At another meeting some months afterwards
in C&mdash;&mdash;, there was a powerful work of
grace, in every respect like those to which I
have alluded. One old man professed faith
in Christ, who was the third unbeliever in
the family who had been led to Christ by the
same copy of James’ Anxious Inquirer.</p>

<p>I visited J. C. C&mdash;&mdash;, a highly distinguished
civilian of threescore years and ten, who
had filled many important stations in life, and
who now felt that his days were nearly ended.
He took me by the hand very kindly, his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
countenance expressive of deep emotion, and
said, “I am an inquirer on the subject of religion;
<i>I have attended to every thing but my
soul</i>.” I directed him very briefly to the
Saviour, and at the close told him I would
send him a little book in the morning, that
would direct him more fully. He thanked
me kindly for the interest I felt in him, and
urged me to call again. The next morning I
sent him James’ Anxious Inquirer.</p>

<p>In four days after I called again. His
health had improved. He rose to his feet,
his countenance bespoke peace within, and
giving me a cordial shake by the hand, he
said, “I have read that little book through
twice; the great question is answered. I
think I understand what is meant by faith in
Jesus Christ.” I then explained to him as
fully as I could the nature of the <i>new birth</i>&mdash;the
evidences by which we might decide for
ourselves the reality of the change. His very
appearance was entirely changed&mdash;the deep
anxiety that sat on his countenance had
passed away, and happiness was expressed
in every feature.</p>

<p>In a few days he was able to walk, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
called to see me. He said he had read the
book through again; that it was “<i>a great
book</i>; but the writer had omitted one important
point&mdash;he did not inform the reader how
long the work of sanctification must be continued
after a man was justified; that justification
was an act <i>instantaneous</i>, but sanctification
was a work.” I replied, “Our Saviour
said to the thief on the cross, ‘This day thou
shalt be with me in paradise;’ here sanctification
was completed in a few hours.” “I
thank you, sir, that is enough: here is a
check for $30, for the Tract Society; it is
doing a great work.”</p>

<p>For six years he remained steadfast in the
great doctrines of salvation by faith in Christ,
and in a blameless Christian life, though ever
distrustful of himself. Soon after his death
in February, 1856, at the age of seventy-seven,
the Rev. Mr. M&mdash;&mdash; justly said of him,
“Well-deserved tributes have been paid by
the governor of the commonwealth, and by
the legislature and other public bodies to
the distinguished public worth and private
virtues of this eminent citizen. His views of
salvation by faith in the crucified Redeemer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
were clear and scriptural, and showed that
the powers of a vigorous and highly cultivated
mind had been brought to bear upon the
all-important subject. He often expressed
surprise that any one could read the holy
Scriptures in the proper spirit, and not be
convinced of the reality of religion, the divinity
of the Saviour, and the atoning efficacy of
his precious blood. His faith was simple and
childlike. No dependence whatever was placed
in his own merits or righteousness. The
atonement of the Son of God was ‘the anchor
of his soul,’ the basis of his hopes of heaven.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span></p>

<h2 id="CONCLUSION">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>Most of the facts and incidents in these
sketches were committed to writing about
the time of their occurrence, and may be
relied on as simple verities. Much of deep
inherent interest, which met my eye, or fell
upon my ear, might have been added, but
for its inappropriateness to the character of
this work, or unduly swelling the narrative.</p>

<p>Those enjoying the calm refinements of
social life in our favored cities and villages,
who have never entered the abodes of ignorance
and poverty in the moral wastes of
the land, may be unwilling to credit even the
facts related; but in a matter of such infinite
importance as the enlightenment and salvation
of perishing souls, could the real facts
have been consistently withheld?</p>

<p>In the providence of God I was sent out as
a watchman, not upon the walls of Zion, but
<i>outside of those walls</i>; and ought I to conceal
the facts, and report, “All’s well,” when
hundreds of thousands are dying in sin and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
ignorance of the great salvation? Would
not such unfaithfulness be criminal in the
sight of God?</p>

<p>And when the Holy Spirit was poured out
in marvellous effusions, almost as in the day
of Pentecost, should not the facts be recorded
to the praise of divine grace in Jesus Christ?</p>

<p>Reared as I was from infancy under religious
privileges, I had no idea that any part
of our land was in the sad moral condition
which I found actually to exist; or that the
distribution of printed truth and personal labors
“publicly and from house to house,” were
ever so richly blessed. And such erroneous
and defective impressions as to the wants of
our fellow-men, and the encouragements to
labor for their good, I believe are very prevalent.</p>

<p>I remember the day when I was confident
that all around me were well supplied with
the Bible, but on examination I found eight
families, and among them my next door
neighbor, who had no Bible; and a pastor
who regarded Bible efforts in his congregation
as quite unnecessary, on investigation
received from family after family the report,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
“No Bible,” the family of his own sexton being
among the number. An excellent young
man, now a missionary in a distant land, on
faithfully exploring a wealthy county, stated
what he had seen to Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;, a distinguished
Christian citizen. “I have heard of you,”
said the gentleman. “I don’t believe the
statements you are making about the moral
destitutions of this county. I have made up
my mind to go with you and see for myself.”
The young man welcomed his company. In
the first dwelling they entered the family had
no books, not even a Bible. Said Mr. W&mdash;&mdash;,
“Give them $2 50 worth, and I will pay for
them.” In the next they entered, and in the
third, they found equal destitution; and in
each case Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; said, “Give them $2 50
worth, and I will foot the bill.” They went
further, but soon Mr. W&mdash;&mdash; said, “My young
friend, the half is not told; take this $20 and
go on with this heaven-directed work.”</p>

<p>As to the rich blessing that has attended
the reading of books and tracts, it is well for
those reared in the midst of church privileges
and good libraries to consider how different
the influence of a good book may be on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
such as have few books, or none at all.
Take, if you please, a prosperous family in
the interior of the country, far from any
book-store, who may have an old family
Bible, a few school-books, or perhaps some
other old books moral and religious. A colporteur
enters with his saddle-bags of beautiful
books. The children are almost frantic
with joy. Each member of the family gets a
book. It is devoured with greediness&mdash;not
by a gospel-hardened sinner, but by one who
has few or no gospel privileges.</p>

<p>Is it strange that such a one, on reading
the Pilgrim’s Progress, the Anxious Inquirer,
or Come to Jesus, is immediately awakened
to seek for pardon and salvation? Is it not
rather <i>more strange</i>, that every one who attentively
and solemnly reads such a book is
not led to Christ?</p>

<p>And when we come down to those who are
wholly destitute of books, who rarely hear a
sermon, and yet are able to read, the effect is
often still more powerful for good.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that has been done,
I believe <i>one half</i> of all the families in our
land now belong to one of these two classes.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>

<p>Hence the necessity of this system of evangelization.
We fear the time is far distant
when our country will be so well supplied
with churches and pastors as to reach the
surging masses of all languages that are
crowding our vast territories, seeking homes
for themselves and families.</p>

<p>Let each one ask himself, in view of the
final account he must give to God, “What
can I do for these perishing thousands?”
Here a way is pointed out by which every
one can do something, either by <i>laboring</i>,
<i>praying</i>, or <i>giving</i>. An old lady unable to
move about, with an income of $600 per annum,
gave $150 each year as the salary of a
colporteur, and she had a few other ladies to
meet her once each week to pray for God’s
blessing on his labors. Few men in latter
days have done as much good as this colporteur,
Mr. C&mdash;&mdash;r. She thus labored by proxy.
The man is still living who at first paid $150
for my support, and was thus instrumental in
whatever good I have done. Hundreds would
be ready to go and work in this department
of Christian effort if means were provided.</p>

<p>This system of labor developes the dormant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
power of the church. Hundreds whose
influence for good was never felt outside of
their own family circle, have become successful
laborers in this heaven-born work. Many
of them are now able ministers of the New
Testament, who would have remained “hewers
of wood and drawers of water” had it
not been for this system of doing good. I
call to mind the names of a score of men who
have been brought into the work of the ministry
either directly or indirectly by this system
of colportage.</p>

<p>Shall a work of so much power for good,
and so much needed, be unsupported? The
price of one ocean steamer would support it
efficiently over the whole land for one year.</p>

<p>The issuing of this history is what the
writer never intended to do, or allow others
to do while he lived. He has prepared it, if
he knows his own heart, purely with the hope
it may do good. He trusts it may suggest to
some whose supreme desire is to honor Christ
in the salvation of men, a way by which they
may gain the blessing of those who “turn
many to righteousness,” and who shall shine,
above the brightness of the firmament, “as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
the stars for ever and ever.” That this may
be the gracious reward of him who writes,
and of all who read this book, is the fervent
prayer of <span class="smcap">the pioneer colporteur in the
Alleghany mountains</span>.</p>

<blockquote>

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;The labors of this single-hearted, devoted, and
fearless servant of Christ were at first secured for one year
to explore some of these wild mountain gorges. Having
been continued five years as above, they were extended
southward in the Alleghany range, and at length over
the whole states of Virginia and North Carolina, till he
had had the co&ouml;peration of three hundred colporteurs,
and their visits had reached five hundred thousand families,
over forty thousand of whom attended no place of
evangelical worship. Usually they read the Scriptures,
conversed, and prayed in each family; and they gathered
into Sabbath-schools seventy thousand children, many of
whom received their first book and learned their first lesson
through this agency. Such wonderful effusions of the
Holy Spirit as in some instances above recorded, were rarely
witnessed, but these continued labors were evidently
owned in the conversion of multitudes of souls. As the
writer of the above sketches, now a commissioned minister
of Christ, has well said, “It must have been the work of
God, who causes weak things to confound the mighty. It
was God who led the way, and raised up men and means,
and guided his servants, and blessed them with his presence;
and to him be all the glory.”</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.</p>

<p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</h2>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works</h3>

<p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.</p>

<p>1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.</p>

<p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>

<blockquote><p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United
  States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost
  no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use
  it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with
  this eBook or online
  at <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
  are not located in the United States, you'll have to check the laws
  of the country where you are located before using this
  ebook.</p></blockquote>

<p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.</p>

<p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.</p>

<p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.</p>

<p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that</p>

<ul>
<li>You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."</li>

<li>You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.</li>

<li>You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.</li>

<li>You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.</li>
</ul>

<p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.</p>

<p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>

<p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.</p>

<p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.  </p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.</p>

<p>The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

<h3 class="pg">Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3 class="pg">Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
